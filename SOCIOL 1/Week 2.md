# Week 2
## Socialization
* **Q:** What is socialization?
* "Socialization is the process through which people learn the culture of their society" (C&E 2016:81)
* It is how sociologists account for human behavior - at the core of individual development and societal continuity is 'cultural acquisition'
* It helps answer the question:
  * **Q:** How do we become human - that is, effective participants and contributing members of society?
  * By learning: The acquisition of cultural knowledge (e.g., valued skills and shared understandings) promotes personal growth and social organization
### Nature vs Nurture
* **Q:** Do *genetic* factors or *environmental* factors best explain the behavioral traits of humans?
* 'It is our nature to be nurtured'; e.g., neuroplasticity refers to the ability of neural networks in the brain to change in response to environmental influence
* A fundamental tenet of sociology underscores the significance of socialization:
  * 'We are greatly influenced by our social surroundings'
  * Culture knowledge is both absorbed through observation and deliberately transmitted through formal instruction and reinforcement
* Sociolization is an orderly process
  * Learning corresponds to physical maturation, to social roles and social identities
  * "The lifelong process of learning the norms, values, bejavior, and social skills appropriate to your social position, such a syour age, gender, or social class" (98).
    * For example, you will eventually age out of being a student and into an employee.  Possibly become parents, or even grandparents, etc.
### Four Basic Components of Socialization
* "It always involves (1) and agent - someone who serves as a source for what is being learned... (2) a learning process; (3) a target - a person who is being socialized; and (4) an outcome - something that is being learned" (D&C 2019:71)
* The *age* of the 'target' is of special importance
  * **'Primary socialization'** occurs during ***childhood*** - the target is characterized by permeability, dependency and restricted agency
    * "The most intense period of cultural learning... occurs during infancy and childhood" (100).
  * **'Secondary socialization'** occurs during **adolescence and throughout adulthood**.
    * This would include cultural learning during the 'teenage,' 'young adult,' 'midlife,' and 'later life' stages of the modern life-course
  * "These stages are *social* as well as biological" (110).
  * "The idea of the teenager... didn't exist until the early twentieth century, when compulsory education and child-labor laws were enacted."
  * Today, the acquired notion is that this age is...
    * "A time to learn, grow, and make choices about the kind of adult one wants to someday become" (111).
  * Similarly, the 'midlife stage' is considered a new life stage of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries
  * "Midlife is distinct from other life course stages in that there is not an 'official' or legal age of entry" (113).
  * We have learned to expect a 'midlife crisis' (45-65) searching for signs and symptoms of its occurrence.
* The socialization process also includes 'agents' - the source for what is being learned
  * Families, schools, peer groups, mass media and work play essential roles as 'agents of socialization'
  * The *family*, *school* and *workplace* are three 'formal' agents - they are tasked with 'training'
* The family is the most important initial socializi
  * [FILL]
*  The school is intentionally designed to socialize individuals, "whereby students pursue a defined curriculum of subjects..."
  * [FILL]
  * "Another key mechanism through which schools socialize hildren is the 'hidden curriculum'...".
  * "The hidden curriculum refers to the subtle ways that [students] are exposed to different messages and curricular materials from their teachers" (102).
  * For example, messaging about 'gender rules'
#### Gender
* "Becoming a Gendered Body," by Karin Martin
  * Study illustrates how everyday social interactions in preschools teach children the *rules of gender*
  * Teachers instruct children how to behave in ways believed to be 'gender appropriate' (e.g., dress and conduct for boys and girls)
  * **Formal Behaviors:** Girls were more likely to be encouraged to pursue formal behaviors (82%)
  * **Controlling Voice:** Girls were 3x more likely to be instructed to use 'quieter' and 'nicer' voices
  * **Bodily Instructions:** Girls were more likely to be issued substantive and directive instructions (116)
* [FILL]

---

* The workplace - as a socializing agent - instructs employees how to behave while "on the job"
* Besides learning how to perform specialized tasks, workers acquire professional values and ethics
* They also learn to manage their meotions according to the 'feeing rules' of the workplace (emotional labor)
* The *peer group* and *mass media* are two 'informal' agents of socialization
* Unlike parents, teachers, and bosses, peers and entertainers do not occupy formal positions of power
* However, they relay consistent cultural messaging in terms of *how to think, look and act* (e.g., identity)
* "The peer group consists of individuals of a similar age" - experiencing the stages of life concurrently
* [FILL]
* "Media... has a powerful impact on our lives" (104).
  * Mass media messaging is isseminated through a dizzying array of electronic communications
  * With more Americans tethered to their smartphones, they are constantly exposed to advertisements, news, podcasts, videos, music, and social media.
* "Media... is particularly influential in shaping the beliefs, behaviors, social interactions, and relationships of children, teens, and young adults" (104).
* Youth report modeling their behavior on their favorite videos, programs, and shows
* "Influencers are also cited as powerful influences..."
* While TV remains an important socializing agent, more of teen socialization is taking place online.
  * "Fully 95% of teens have access to a smartphone, and 45% say they are online 'almost constantly'."
* "Anybody's Son Will Do," by Gwynne Dyer
  * 'Resocialization' occurs when individuals are *reprogrammed* to internalize new and usually extreme values, beliefs and norms
  * "When an individual gives up one way of life and one set of values for another" (158).
  * Resocialization customarily takes place within 'total institutions; - in which subjects are intentionally isolated from wider society (e.g., military barrack)
    * Restricted access to the outside world
    * Behavior is heavily controlled and regulated
    * Individuals are stripped of civilian identity
    * Basic training is the 'method' used to turn "young men into sodiers - people who kill other people and expose themselves to death" (159).
  * By isolating recruits and applying pressure, basic training transforms their values and loyalties
    * Social influence is amplified with a 'captive audience'
    * What becomes valued through resocialization is *conformity, obedience, and loyalty to the military*
    * "The recruits' total identification with the other members of their unit is the most important lesson of all..." (166)
  * War: Anybody's Son Will Do (1983)
