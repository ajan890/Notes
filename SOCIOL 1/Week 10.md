# Week 10
## Racial and Ethnic Inequality
* Sociologists define racial and ethnic inequality
* As the difference in the wealth, status, and power that dominant and minority racial and ethnic groups have within a society
* "Members of a minority group are disadvantaged as compared to the dominant group." (378).
* **Q:** How do sociologists define 'race' and 'ethnicity'?
  * 'Race' refers to a set of visible physical traits that characterize a population, e.g., skin color, facial features, hair texture, eye color, height, etc.
  * Biology: *Phenotype*, or observable physical traits, and *ancestry*, or genetic background
* "While the idea of race implies something fixed and biological..."
  * 'Ethnicity' refers to a set of cultural qualities that characterize a population; e.g., shared language, religion, or history
  * "Ethnic differences are wholly learned..." (379).
  * "An ethnic group is one whose members share a distinct awareness of a common cultural identity..."
    * Asian: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Thai, Malaysian, etc.
* **Q:** How do sociologists measure racial and ethnic inequality?
  * Racial and ethnic inequality is commonly measured by variations in average socioeconomic outcomes among racial and ethnic groups
  * Comparison of average socioeconomic outcomes
  * Prevalent socioeconomic inequality metrics
    * Unemployment rates
    * Poverty rates
    * High school dropout rates
    * Educational attainment rates
    * Median household income levels
    * Home ownership rates
    * Median household wealth levels
  * Black and Hispanic Americans are more likely than Asian and White Americans to experience:
    * Higher rates of unemployment, poverty, and high school dropout
    * Lower rates of educational attainment, median income, homeownership, and household wealth
#### "Race, Homeownership, and Wealth," by T. Shapiro
* "Wealth is a special kind of money because it represents ownership and control of resources" (267).
* Wealth is "utilized to launch social mobility, create opportunities and statusm or pass along advantages to one's children" (268).
* In addition to socioeconomic factors...
  * Sociologists also study variaytions in rates of incarceration, police brutality, health outcomes (e.g., morality rates) and residential segregation
  * E.g., The incarceration rate of Black Americans is five times higher than White Americans.
* Out of the 2.1 million Americans incarcerated in 2019... Blacks and Hispanics constitute 56% of the prison population - double the size of their overall combined population at 28%.
* "Most sociologists agree on the facts about racial and ethnic inequality but disagree on how to interpret them" (404).
  * "Is racial or ethnic inequality primarily the result of a person's racial or ethnic background... or does it reflect a person's class position?"
* Devah Pager's (2003) study provides evidence for present-day racially discriminatory behaviors...
* Whereas William Julius Wilson's (2009) study stresses the effects of 'impersonal economic forces'
* Thomas Shapiro (2006) explains wealth inequality in terms of historical racial inequalities

## Racism and Discrimination
* 'Racism' provides one explanation for the existence of racial and ethnic inequalities
* "The attribution of characteristics of superiority or inferiority to a population sharing certain physically inherited characteristics" (381).
* Racial and ethnic inequality is caused by racism.
* The "two main components of racism are prejudice and discrimination" (381).
* 'Prejudice' refers tp megatove attotides held toward members of racial and ethnic groups.
* 'Discrimination' refers to behaviors that deny these members opportunities and resources.
* Two types of discrimination
  * 'Individual discrimination' occurs when an individual member of a racial or ethnic group is intentionally treated unfavorably (e.g., denied employment)
  * 'Institutional discrimination' occurs when laws, public policies, or common practices systematically disadvantage racial or ethnic minorities (e.g., public school funding, redlining in real estate and housing, racial profiling, drug possession penalties, etc.)
* 'Overt racism' refers to explicit and undisguised racial prejudices and discriminatory behaviors
  * E.g., Jim Crow era (*de jure* racial segregation)
* 'Aversive racism' refers to racial attitudes and behaviors expressed in terms of discomfort and uneasiness (e.g., unconscious or implicit biases)

#### "The Mark of a Criminal Record," by Devah Pager
* **Q:** Does a criminal record result in the reduction of employment opportunities?  Does the "effect of a criminal record differ for black and white applicants?"
  * Pager's study reveals the effects of an applicant's criminal status and racial identity on job opportunities
  * Field experiment: Subjects varied in terms of criminal status and racial identity:
    * "Two 'independent' variables: (i) Criminal status (non-offender and offender) and (ii). Racial identity (white and black)
    * One 'dependent' variable: 'Callbacks' from employers
    * Four male auditors, two blacks and two whites
      * Tester were 'matched' on the basis of age (23 years old), region (Milwaukee), physical appearance and 'style of self-presentation'
      * "Educational attainment and work experience were made similar for the purpose of the applications" (37).
    * "A total of 350 employers were audited during the course of this study: 150 by the white pair and 200 by the black pair" (38).
    * "Given that all testers presented roughly identical credentials, the differences experienced among groups of testers can be attributed to the effects of race or criminal status."
* **Finding 1:** The effect of a criminal record for whites
  * "There is a large and significant effect of a criminal record, with 34% of whites without criminal records receiving callbacks, relative to only 17% of whites with criminal records."
  * A criminal record reduces the likelihood of a callback by 50%.
  * Percentage of blacks dropped from 14% to 5%.
  * White male applicants with a criminal record have a greater chance of receiving callbacks than blacks male applicants without a criminal record.
  * Based on the preferences and hiring decisions of employers, Pager found that "race continues to play a dominant role in shaping employment opportunities, equal to or greater than the impact of a criminal record".
  * While employers are generally reluctant to hire any ex-offenders...
    * "The *ratio* of callbacks for nonoffenders relative to ex-offenders for *whites* is 2:1..., for *blacks*... nearly 3:1."
    * "The effect of a criminal record is thus 40% larger for blacks than for whites" (42).
  * "In our frenzy of locking people up, our 'crime control' policies may in fact exacerbate the very conditions that lead to crime in the first place" (43).
    * "Quality steady employment is one of the strongest predictors of desistance \[abstinence] from crime."
    * *Yet, criminal records diminish employment opportunities*
#### "The Economic Plight of Inner-City Black Males," by William Julius Wilson
* Structural changes in the U.S. economy during the 1970s contributed to the economic decline of black, inner-city communities
* Impersonal economic forces cause racial inequality
* The transition from a *manufacturing economy* to *a service economy* resulted in massive industrial layoffs
* In the 1970s, black males were overwhelmingly employed in manufacturing industries
* These jobs were unionized, did not require a college degree, yet paid livable, middle-class wages.
* New service industry jobs emerged in the suburbs - outside of the central-city
* These jobs were high-skill occupations, requiring educational credentials (e.g., bachelor's degree)
* Unskilled black laborers, lacking college credentials, were unable to compete for these positions
* The loss of center-city industries led to the decline of city revenues and exacerbated 'central city flight'
* Impacted: School districts, police departments, fire departments, parks and recreation departments
* *The central-city was transformed into a place of high unemployment and failing school systems*
* Other institutional changes were occurring:
  * "Through the last decades of the twentieth century... the system of American criminal justice turned away from the rehabilitative project" (157).
  * Politicians vowed to 'get tough on crime' - leading to a dramatic increase in the number of incarcerated
* Incarceration is a major impediment to employment - a criminal background increases the likelihood of unemployment
* Creation of an 'underclass' (lowest social stratum)
* Inner-city blacks become isolated and trapped within a cycle of poverty, drugs, and crime
* All of this occurred following critical legislative and political successes for Black Americans:
  * Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed racial discrimination; Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) investigated claims of racial discrimination; National Voting Right Act of 1965 criminalized discriminatory voting practices (e.g., outlawing 'literacy texts'); and Executive Order No. 11246 established affirmative action programs
* In recent years...
  * Impersonal economic [FILL]
* "There's a clear class divide between workers who can and cannot telework.  Fully 62% of workers with a bachelor's degree or more education say their work can be done from home." - PRC (12/9/20)
* "This compares with only 23% of those without a four-year college degree.  Similarly, while a majority of upper-income workers can do their work from home, most lower- and middle-income workers cannot."

#### "Who Got a Lot Richer and Who Didn't During the Pandemic" - The Wall Street Journal (12/4/23)
* "Between 2019 and 2021, the median household's net worth increased 30% to $116900..."
* "Home values shot up, and... many people paid down debt and boosted savings."
* However, gains in wealth were not equally shared among racial and ethnic groups:
  * "The wealth of white and Asian households increased the most in total dollars during those years."
  * "For many Black and Hispanic families, the boost wasn't enough to lift them fully out of debt."
  * "Asian households held the most wealth overall, the report found.  Their net worth grew 43% to $320900 in 2021... White households posted a 23% increase to $250400."
  * "1 in 4 Black... and 1 in 7 Hispanic households in the U.S. either had no wealth or were in deby in 2021."
