## Racial and Ethnic Inequality
* Sociologists define racial and ethnic inequality
* As the difference in the wealth, status, and power that dominant and minority racial and ethnic groups have within a society
* "Members of a minority group are disadvantaged as compared to the dominant group." (378).
* **Q:** How do sociologists define 'race' and 'ethnicity'?
  * 'Race' refers to a set of visible physical traits that characterize a population, e.g., skin color, facial features, hair texture, eye color, height, etc.
  * Biology: *Phenotype*, or observable physical traits, and *ancestry*, or genetic background
* "While the idea of race implies something fixed and biological..."
  * 'Ethnicity' refers to a set of cultural qualities that characterize a population; e.g., shared language, religion, or history
  * "Ethnic differences are wholly learned..." (379).
  * "An ethnic group is one whose members share a distinct awareness of a common cultural identity..."
    * Asian: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Thai, Malaysian, etc.
* **Q:** How do sociologists measure racial and ethnic inequality?
  * Racial and ethnic inequality is commonly measured by variations in average socioeconomic outcomes among racial and ethnic groups
  * Comparison of average socioeconomic outcomes
  * Prevalent socioeconomic inequality metrics
    * Unemployment rates
    * Poverty rates
    * High school dropout rates
    * Educational attainment rates
    * Median household income levels
    * Home ownership rates
    * Median household wealth levels
  * Black and Hispanic Americans are more likely than Asian and White Americans to experience:
    * Higher rates of unemployment, poverty, and high school dropout
    * Lower rates of educational attainment, median income, homeownership, and household wealth
#### "Race, Homeownership, and Wealth," by T. Shapiro
* "Wealth is a special kind of money because it represents ownership and control of resources" (267).
* Wealth is "utilized to launch social mobility, create opportunities and statusm or pass along advantages to one's children" (268).
* In addition to socioeconomic factors...
  * Sociologists also study variaytions in rates of incarceration, police brutality, health outcomes (e.g., morality rates) and residential segregation
  * E.g., The incarceration rate of Black Americans is five times higher than White Americans.
* Out of the 2.1 million Americans incarcerated in 2019... Blacks and Hispanics constitute 56% of the prison population - double the size of their overall combined population at 28%.
* "Most sociologists agree on the facts about racial and ethnic inequality but disagree on how to interpret them" (404).
  * "Is racial or ethnic inequality primarily the result of a person's racial or ethnic background... or does it reflect a person's class position?"
* Devah Pager's (2003) study provides evidence for present-day racially discriminatory behaviors...
* Whereas William Julius Wilson's (2009) study stresses the effects of 'impersonal economic forces'
* Thomas Shapiro (2006) explains wealth inequality in terms of historical racial inequalities
