# Week 4
## Social Networks
* Sociologists make important distinctions between social networks, groups, and organizations
* 'Social networks' refer to "all the direct and indirect connections that link one particular indvidual or group with other people or groups" (166)/
* Webs of strong and weak social ties
### Social Groups
* "A social group is a collection of people who have common identity and who regularly interacyt with one another on the basis of shared expectations..." (170).
* Groups are characterized by a sense of membership, regular interaction, shared norms and goals
* A sense of 'belonging' characterizes group life.
* "Group life differs greatly in how intensely members experience it" (170).
#### Primary groups and Secondary groups
* "Primary groups are small groups characterized by face-to-face interaction, intimacy and a strong sense of commitment" (e.g., family and friends).
* 'We': Mutual identification
* C.H. Cooley "believed that they were the basic forms of association, exerting a long-lasting influence on the development of our social selves" (170).
* Primary groups are characterized by strong sense of emotional involvement and attachment.

#### Primary Groups
* "The Importance of Primary Groups," by Dexter Dunphy
  * The military unit as a 'surrogate family'
  * "The soldier fights to protect the primary group and live up to the expectations of his fellow group members" (37).
* **Q:** Why did the Wehrmacht continue to fight even when "German capitulation was inevitable"?
  * "It appears that a soldier's ability to resist is a function of the capacity of his immediate primary group to avoid social disintegration... when [it] met his basic organic needs" - affection, esteem, and power - "disruption... was minimized" (35).
* "Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple," by Charles Lindholm
  * Primary group bonds help us to understand one of the "most enigmatic modern cult movements" that ended in tragedy
  * In 1978, 909 people died by mass suicide.
  * Lindholm: The evidence does not indicate either *insanity* or *force* in precipitating this outcome
    * Members were "willing to give up their lives rather than lose their community" (48).
    * "The Peoples Temple offered an alternative to lives of desperation, isolation, and humiliation" (45).
    * It offered inclusion, belonging and purpose based on the principles of equality and mutual care
  * Jones fostered a community "where people worked and lived together in harmony, without fear of hunger, loneliness, prejudice, or poverty" (44).
  * "Members practiced true social integration' (45).
#### Secondary Groups
* In contrast, secondary groups are large, impersonal and formal
* They "seldom involve intense emotional ties, enduring relationships, powerful commitments to the group itself, or a feeling of unity" (170).
* E.g., Businesses, schools, athletic clubs, etc.
* ""We rarely feel we can be ourselves in a secondary group; rather, we are often playing a role...".
* Yet, "secondary groups may become primary groups."
* "For example, when students taking a course together socialize after their class, they create bonds of friendship that constitute a primary group" (171).
* Secondary group are also differentiated by the specificity of their goals
* Secondary groups are likely to have specific goals, where as primary groups tend to have more general or diffuse goals
* E.g., Earning a college degree and earning a living
* However, both primary groups and secondary groups require "conformity" from their members
* "When an individual adheres to group norms and standards, it is called conformity" (D&C 2019:482)
* "It refer to a change in one's attitudes or behavior in order to fit in" (e.g., adopting the latest fashion trend).
#### Group Pressure and Conformity
* "Effects of Group Pressure upon the Modification and Distortion of Judgements," by Solomon Asch (1952)
  * Experiment investigated 'majority influence'
  * "The processes by which a group's majority pressures an individual member to conform or adopt specific positions on some issue" (D&C)
  * This study "showed that... groups can pressure their members to change their judgments and conform with the majority's position..."
  * Even when that position is obviously incorrect."
  * "Nearly one-third of the participants [naive subjects\] were incorrect" (484).
* However, the error rate was less than 1 percent for those not subjected to social pressure
* 'Normative social influence'
* Conformity is motivated by the desire to avoid standing out negatively - "being criticized, disapproved of, or shunned" (Gilovich et al. 2016:312).
* Conformity and 'reference groups'
  * The reference group is "a group that provides a standard for judging one's attitudes or behaviors" (Giddens et al. 2020:176).
  * "Reference groups may be primary (such as the family) or secondary (such as a group of soldiers)."
* Reference groups "may even be fictional."
  * "One of the chief functions of advertising is to create a set of imaginary reference groups that will influence customers' buying habits" (176).
  * Conformity: "Drink this beer, and you will be a member of the carefree in-group in this ad."
* An organization is "a group with an identifiable membership that engages in concentred collective action to achieve a common purpose" (174).
* It is "a large group of individuals with a definite set of *authority* relations."
* E.g., Universities, religious bodies, corporations, etc.
  * Because organizations are defined by a definite set of authority relations, they involve 'obedience'
  * 'Obedience' refers submitting to the demands of an authority figure (e.g., teacher, employer, etc.)
  * 'Formal organizations' are based on explicit rules, regulations, and procedures (i.e., bureaucratic)
#### Bureaucracy
  * "A type of organization marked by a clear hierarchy of authority... written rules of procedure and staffed by full-time, salaried officials" (179).
  * 'Formal relations' are created by the organization's rules and regulations
* 'Rational-legal authority'
  * This type of domination "rests on a belief in the legality of enacted rules and the right of those elevated to authority... to issue commands" (E&A 2015:204).
  * "Bureaucracies have become the dominant form of social organization in modern society."
* In bureaucracies, "power resides with the at the top."
* "Who says organization says oligarchy": Society's major organizations are 'ruled by the few'
* "According to Michels, the flow of power toward the top is an inevitable part of an increasingly bureaucratized world - hence the 'iron law'" (188).

### Obedience
* "Behavioral Study of Obedience," by Stanley Milgram
* The Milgram Experiment
  * **Q:** Under what conditions would a person obey authority who commanded actions that went against conscience?"
  * Experimenter involved an experimenter, a learner, and a *teacher* (research subject or 'naive' subject)
  * "The experimenter told the participants that the purpose of the research was to study the effects of punishment (that is, electric shock) on learning" (332).
  * Word-pair test: Wrong answers were 'punished'
  * The teacher was instructed to administer an electric shock following each wrong answer provided by the learner...
  * While continuing to *increase* the administered voltage with each wrong answer.
    * Maximum shock administered = degree of obedience
    * The instrument panel consisted of 30 lever switches set in a horizontal line - ranging from 15 to 450 volts
  * Verbal designations: Slight shock, moderate shock, strong shock, very strong shock, intense shock, extreme intensity shock, danger severe shock, and the last two switches were simply marked 'XXX'
    * At 75 volts = learner grunted loudly
    * At 120 volts = learner shouted shocks were painful
    * At 150 volts = learner demanded to be released
    * At 270 volts = learner produced agonized scream
    * At 300 volts = learner desperately pleaded to be released
    * At 315 volts = learner gave out a violent scream
    * Above 315 volts = learner was silent
  * Experimenter feedback: "If the subject indicated his unwillingness to go on, the experimenter responded with a sequence of 'prods'...
 (375)
    * Prod 1: 'Please continue,' or 'Please go on'
    * Prod 2: 'The experiment requires that you continue'
    * Prod 3: 'It is absolutely essential that you continue'
    * Prod 4: 'You have no other choice, you must go on'
  * Results of the study:
    * 65% (or 26 out of 40) of ordinary subjects were prepared to administer potentially fata electric shock when encouraged to do so by what they perceived as a legitimate authority figure - in this case, a man in a white coat.
    * Signs of extreme tension
      * "Subjects were observed to sweat, tremble, stutter, bit their lips, groan, and dig their fingernails into their flesh..."
  * Before conducting his experiments, Milgram asked his students to "predict the behavior of 100 *hypothetical subjects* based on this experimental situation
    * "The estimates ranged from 0 to 3%; i.e., the most "pessimistic" member of the class predicted that out of 100 persons, 3 would continue through to the most potent shock available on the shock generator - 450 volts.  The class mean was 1.2%." (376)
      * This is why experiments like this should be conducted; 1.2% is very far from 65%.
  * Replication of Milgram Experiment - ABC, "Basic Instincts: The Science of Evil"
    * The Milgram Experiment Revisited (2007)
    * Results: 65% of male subjects and 73% of female subjects "agreed to administer increasingly painful electric shocks when ordered by an authority figure."
    * Jerry Burger's replication was carefully reviewed and approved by his university's IRB (Santa Clara Univ.)
    * Additional procedures were implemented to reduce subjects' risk of exposure to extreme stress
    * Finding:"Today people obey the experimenter... at about the same rate they did 45 years ago."

### Relations Between Social Groups
* Social groups: Bonds between group members are "sometimes strengthened by scorning other groups."
* "In-groups are groups toward which one feels loyalty and respcet - the groups the 'we' belong to."
* "Out-groups are groups toward which one feels antagonism and contempt - "those people" (175)
* One source if intergroup conflict is competition
* "Overt conflict may develop because groups have an underlying *opposition of interest* - a benefit of one must come at a cost to the other" (D&C 2019:490)
* Groups compete with one another over desired resources like wealth, status, and power.
* "Even when an underlying 'opposition of interest' is not present...
  * Strong group identification can, by itself, produce biased behavior towards out-groups" (D&C 2019:452).
  * "People have a fundamental tendency to like their own group and to dislike... opposing groups."
* This is due to "ethnocentrism"
* Ethnocentrism refers to the tendency to regard one's group as superior to other groups - and regard other groups as inferior
* This attitude often leads to prejudicial attitudes and discriminatory behaviors
* "Social Categorization and Intergroup Behavior," by Henri Tajfel et al. (1971)
  * "Minimal group paradigm"
  * Study found that even arbitrary or trivial distinctions between groups trigger in-group favoritism and out-group discrimination
  * Experimental design eliminated (i) competitive self-interest and (ii) preconceived negative attitudes
  * Boys were randomly assigned into two groups - 'under-estimators' and 'over-estimators' of dots...
  * And this was sufficient to induce favoritism: *Subjects gave more money to in-group members...*
* Social categorization - or grouping - produced favoritism and discriminatory behavior
* Subjects were provided the choice of being fair or discriminating in the allocation of rewards.
* "Their actions are unambiguously directed at favoring the members of their in-group..." (172).
