# Week 5
## Deviance
* Any behavior departing from the range of conduct regarded as 'normal' within a social context or society
* "Nonconformity to a set of norms that a significant number of people in a community or society accept" (Giddens et al. 2020:200).
* Deviance involves behaviors that violate either social norms or laws (norms enforced by state authorities)
* "Many deviant behaviors... are not criminal" - and even some "crimes... are quite normative" (207).
* Becker: "Deviance is not a quality of the act... it is a consequence of the application of rules."
* "From a sociological perspective, no act or belief... is inherently deviant" (Ritzer & Murphy 2019:144)
* Deviance is a culturally 'relative' phenomenon - as opposed to being 'absolute' or universal'
* Cultural relativity defeats any attempt to compile a list of acts which are universally deviant.
* Behavior that is viewed as 'normal' in one context or society may be seen as quite aberrant in another
* "Acts may be criminal or deviant because - and only because - they are proscribed legally and/or socially" (Gibbs 1996:16)
* The *rules* - not the *act* - determines what is deviant.
  * For example, caffeine is a drug just like cocaine or meth, but it is socially acceptable to consume caffeine every morning.
  * Two people punching each other in a boxing ring is not deviant, but two people punching each other in the street is.
### Four sociological theories of deviance
* Provides sociological explanations of the causes of deviance:
#### 1. Strain Theory
* "Functionalist theories argue that crime occurs when the aspirations of individuals and groups do not coincide witha vailable opportunities" (202).
* Social inequality creates discrepancy between 'values' and 'opportunities'
* The lack of conventional means and opportunities for achieving cultural goals produces 'strain'
* *It's this feeling of 'frustration' - due to structural pressure - that motivates nonconformist or deviant conduct.*
* "Deviant or nonconformist behavior is 'called-forth' by social structural pressure.
* Example:
  * Cheating is considered deviant behavior.  If you are struggling in a math class, you are more like to cheat compared to someone with the skills.
* While every society promotes cultural goals for its members to pursue, "Disadvantaged people have limited or no conventional opportunities for advancement" (203).
* This condition of 'relative deprivation' may motivate individuals to engage in deviant behavior.
* The individual is faced with five 'logically possible' modes of adaptation - based on the acceptance or rejection of:
  1. Cultural Goals - Accept or Reject
  2. Legitimate Means - Accept or Reject
```
Mode of Adaptation | Legitimate Means | Cultural Goals
Conformity         |  Accept          |  Accept
Innovation         |  Reject          |  Accept
Ritualism          |  Accept          |  Reject
Retreatism         |  Reject          |  Reject
Rebellion          |  New means       |  New Goals
```
#### 2. Differential Association Theory
* People *learn* to be deviant through their exposure to and associations with others involved in deviance
* "The more we associate with people whose behavior is deviant, the greater the likelihood that our behavior will also be deviant" (Chambliss & Eglitis 2016:141).
* "Becoming a Marihuana User," by Howard Becker
  * **Q:** Why do some individuals - and not others - become 'users of marijuana for pleasure'?
  * *Broader sociological question:* Why do some individuals - and not others - engage in 'deviant' behaviors (e.g., like smoking marijuana)?
* Reigning explanation of the time:
  * "The presence of a given kind of \[deviant] behavior in an individual can best be explained as the result of some trait which predisposes or motivates him to engage in this behavior" (221).
* Becker's thesis:
  * Through social interaction, individuals learn how to become 'users of marijuana for pleasure'
  * Deviant behavior is learned in interaction with other persons in a process of communication - e.g., the techniques, effects, and motives of deviant behavior.
* "An individual, will be able to use marihuana for pleasure *only when he goes through a process of learning* to conceive of it as an object which can be used in this way" (227).
  1. Learning smoking technique
  2. Learning to identify effects
  3. Learning to define effects as pleasurable
* Step 3: Learning to define effects as pleasurable
  * **Q:** Is 'getting high' necessarily enjoyable?
    * Symptoms are "not automatically, nor necessarily pleasurable" - as some users described the experience as 'scary', 'frightening', and 'unpleasant' (e.g., "I felt I was going insane...").
    * The novice is 'coached' by seasoned users and taught to "find pleasure in this experience which \[was] at first so frightening."
    * "You have to like reassure them..." (226)
    * "He \[or she] has learned, in short, to answer 'Yes' to the question: 'Is it fun?'" (228).
* White collar crime: Work-related criminal behavior committed by people of high social status
* A new corporate executive learns from coworkers that embezzling company funds is the 'norm'
* Sports: Athletes learn the 'informal norms' of the game - encouraged by teammates to violate official rules

#### 3. Labeling Theory
* Deviant behavior is a consequence of the 'labels' assigned to people
* Labels influence people's perception of those who are labeled - as well as influence the self-perception of those who have been labeled.
* "On Being Sane in Insane Places," by David Rosenhan
  * "What are the social and psychological consequences of being defined - or labeled - by others as deviant?"
  * Study reveals how the label of 'mentally ill' can influence a hospital staff's perceptions of admitted pseudo-patients
  * Design:
    * Eight 'sane' pseudo-patients were admitted to various mental hospitals across the country
    * They gained admission by complaining of 'hearing voices' - while often unclear, these voices said the words, 'empty', 'hollow', and 'thud'
    * As if to say, "my life is empty and hollow" (51)
    * While hospitalized, these subjects behaved normally and cooperatively
    * Upon admission, pseudo-patients "ceased simulating any symptoms of abnormality" (51).
    * "They were motivated not only to behave sanely, but to be paragons of cooperation" (52).
    * Yet, each was discharged with a diagnosis of schizophrenia in remission (hospitalized for 7-52 days)
    * The sanity of the pseudo-patients went *undetected*, despite the so-called 'objective' nature of mental illness
    * Does mental illness reside in the 'minds of patients' or in the 'mind of psychiatrists' (i.e., psychiatric diagnoses)
    * Rosenhan: Once the label of 'mental patient' is applied, all subsequent actions become *interpreted* within the context of this label
    * Labels *bias* and *distort* perception
    * "Given that the patient is in the hospital, he must be psychologically disturbed" (55).
    * Past biographical details and observed behaviors become *interpreted* as *symptoms* - taken as evidence of their mental illness
      * "As far as I can determine..." (54)
      * "All pseudopatients took extensive notes..." (55)
      * "One tacit characteristic..." (55)
    * "The tag \[of mentally ill] profoundly colors others' perceptions of him and his behavior" (54).
