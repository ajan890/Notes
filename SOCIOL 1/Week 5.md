# Week 5
## Deviance
* Any behavior departing from the range of conduct regarded as 'normal' within a social context or society
* "Nonconformity to a set of norms that a significant number of people in a community or society accept" (Giddens et al. 2020:200).
* Deviance involves behaviors that violate either social norms or laws (norms enforced by state authorities)
* "Many deviant behaviors... are not criminal" - and even some "crimes... are quite normative" (207).
* Becker: "Deviance is not a quality of the act... it is a consequence of the application of rules."
* "From a sociological perspective, no act or belief... is inherently deviant" (Ritzer & Murphy 2019:144)
* Deviance is a culturally 'relative' phenomenon - as opposed to being 'absolute' or universal'
* Cultural relativity defeats any attempt to compile a list of acts which are universally deviant.
* Behavior that is viewed as 'normal' in one context or society may be seen as quite aberrant in another
* "Acts may be criminal or deviant because - and only because - they are proscribed legally and/or socially" (Gibbs 1996:16)
* The *rules* - not the *act* - determines what is deviant.
  * For example, caffeine is a drug just like cocaine or meth, but it is socially acceptable to consume caffeine every morning.
  * Two people punching each other in a boxing ring is not deviant, but two people punching each other in the street is.
### Four sociological theories of deviance
* Provides sociological explanations of the causes of deviance:
#### 1. Strain Theory
* "Functionalist theories argue that crime occurs when the aspirations of individuals and groups do not coincide witha vailable opportunities" (202).
* Social inequality creates discrepancy between 'values' and 'opportunities'
* The lack of conventional means and opportunities for achieving cultural goals produces 'strain'
* *It's this feeling of 'frustration' - due to structural pressure - that motivates nonconformist or deviant conduct.*
* "Deviant or nonconformist behavior is 'called-forth' by social structural pressure.
* Example:
  * Cheating is considered deviant behavior.  If you are struggling in a math class, you are more like to cheat compared to someone with the skills.
* While every society promotes cultural goals for its members to pursue, "Disadvantaged people have limited or no conventional opportunities for advancement" (203).
* This condition of 'relative deprivation' may motivate individuals to engage in deviant behavior.
* The individual is faced with five 'logically possible' modes of adaptation - based on the acceptance or rejection of:
  1. Cultural Goals - Accept or Reject
  2. Legitimate Means - Accept or Reject
```
Mode of Adaptation | Legitimate Means | Cultural Goals
Conformity         |  Accept          |  Accept
Innovation         |  Reject          |  Accept
Ritualism          |  Accept          |  Reject
Retreatism         |  Reject          |  Reject
Rebellion          |  New means       |  New Goals
```
#### 2. Differential Association Theory
* People *learn* to be deviant through their exposure to and associations with others involved in deviance
* "The more we associate with people whose behavior is deviant, the greater the likelihood that our behavior will also be deviant" (Chambliss & Eglitis 2016:141).
* "Becoming a Marihuana User," by Howard Becker
  * **Q:** Why do some individuals - and not others - become 'users of marijuana for pleasure'?
  * *Broader sociological question:* Why do some individuals - and not others - engage in 'deviant' behaviors (e.g., like smoking marijuana)?
* Reigning explanation of the time:
  * "The presence of a given kind of \[deviant] behavior in an individual can best be explained as the result of some trait which predisposes or motivates him to engage in this behavior" (221).
* Becker's thesis:
  * Through social interaction, individuals learn how to become 'users of marijuana for pleasure'
  * Deviant behavior is learned in interaction with other persons in a process of communication - e.g., the techniques, effects, and motives of deviant behavior.
* "An individual, will be able to use marihuana for pleasure *only when he goes through a process of learning* to conceive of it as an object which can be used in this way" (227).
  1. Learning smoking technique
  2. Learning to identify effects
  3. Learning to define effects as pleasurable
* Step 3: Learning to define effects as pleasurable
  * **Q:** Is 'getting high' necessarily enjoyable?
    * Symptoms are "not automatically, nor necessarily pleasurable" - as some users described the experience as 'scary', 'frightening', and 'unpleasant' (e.g., "I felt I was going insane...").
    * The novice is 'coached' by seasoned users and taught to "find pleasure in this experience which \[was] at first so frightening."
    * "You have to like reassure them..." (226)
    * "He \[or she] has learned, in short, to answer 'Yes' to the question: 'Is it fun?'" (228).
* White collar crime: Work-related criminal behavior committed by people of high social status
* A new corporate executive learns from coworkers that embezzling company funds is the 'norm'
* Sports: Athletes learn the 'informal norms' of the game - encouraged by teammates to violate official rules

#### 3. Labeling Theory
* Deviant behavior is a consequence of the 'labels' assigned to people
* Labels influence people's perception of those who are labeled - as well as influence the self-perception of those who have been labeled.
* "On Being Sane in Insane Places," by David Rosenhan
  * "What are the social and psychological consequences of being defined - or labeled - by others as deviant?"
  * Study reveals how the label of 'mentally ill' can influence a hospital staff's perceptions of admitted pseudo-patients
  * Design:
    * Eight 'sane' pseudo-patients were admitted to various mental hospitals across the country
    * They gained admission by complaining of 'hearing voices' - while often unclear, these voices said the words, 'empty', 'hollow', and 'thud'
    * As if to say, "my life is empty and hollow" (51)
    * While hospitalized, these subjects behaved normally and cooperatively
    * Upon admission, pseudo-patients "ceased simulating any symptoms of abnormality" (51).
    * "They were motivated not only to behave sanely, but to be paragons of cooperation" (52).
    * Yet, each was discharged with a diagnosis of schizophrenia in remission (hospitalized for 7-52 days)
    * The sanity of the pseudo-patients went *undetected*, despite the so-called 'objective' nature of mental illness
    * Does mental illness reside in the 'minds of patients' or in the 'mind of psychiatrists' (i.e., psychiatric diagnoses)
    * Rosenhan: Once the label of 'mental patient' is applied, all subsequent actions become *interpreted* within the context of this label
    * Labels *bias* and *distort* perception
    * "Given that the patient is in the hospital, he must be psychologically disturbed" (55).
    * Past biographical details and observed behaviors become *interpreted* as *symptoms* - taken as evidence of their mental illness
      * "As far as I can determine..." (54)
      * "All pseudopatients took extensive notes..." (55)
      * "One tacit characteristic..." (55)
    * "The tag \[of mentally ill] profoundly colors others' perceptions of him and his behavior" (54).
  * "The Saints and the Roughnecks," by William Chambliss
    * An ethnographic study of two groups of high school boys from the same community
    * **Q:** Who are the Saints and the Roughnecks?
      * How they're similar: They are two groups of high schoolers involved in similar delinquent activities
      * The Saints cut school, cheated, vandalized, consumed alcohol, and drove recklessly...
      * While the Roughnecks cut school, stole, drank alcohol, and got into fights
    * **Q:** In what respect did these two groups differ?
      * Saints were "eight promising young men - children of good, stable, white, upper middle-class families, active in school affairs, good pre-college students... who were well-dressed and well-mannered.
      * The Roughnecks were "six lower class white boys" - "not-so-well-dressed, not-so-well-mannered, not-so-rich boys... who had a grade popint average just slightly above 'C'."
    * **Q:** How did community members respond?
      * **Saints:** They were considered 'good students' and 'good boys' by teachers, the police, and townspeople - *despite* their deviant activities.
      * **Roughnecks:** They were considered a 'bunch of bad boys' and 'headed for trouble' by teachers, the police, and townspeople - *due to* their deviant activities.
    * **Q:** What became of the Saints and the Roughnecks?
      * Seven of the eight Saints graduated from college; one finished law school, one finished medical school, and one is pursuing a PhD.
      * Two of the six Roughnecks never finished high school; both are serving sentences for murder; one is a small-time gambler, another a trucker.
    * **Q:** According to Chambliss, what accounts for this divergence in adulthood?
      * The Roughnecks came to *internalize* the attitudes of teachers, police, and the community
      * "As that self-conception became more firmly entrenched, they also became willing to try new and more extreme deviances" (326).
      * 'Secondary Deviance'
    * Societal treatment - i.e., the reactions of significant others - facilitate the development of a devaint identity:
      1. Application of a deviant label
      2. Internalization of a deviant self-concept
      3. Then act accordingly (i.e., secondary deviance)

---

**Primary deviance** occurs when an individual commits a non-patterned act of deviance (e.g., initial use of a controlled substance, initial act of theft, initial act of aggression, etc.)
**Secondary deviance** "occurs when a person labeled as deviant accepts the label as part of their identity, and, as a result, begins to act in conformity with that label" (Chambliss and Eglitis 2016:141).

#### 4. Control Theory
* "Control theorists assert that human beings are basically antisocial and assume that deviance is a part of the natural order in society..."
* "... Indiiduals are attracted to the idea of norm violation and thus motivated to deviate" (272).
* Since all people feel an inclination to devaite...
  * "... Concern for deviant motivation alone does not account for the forces leading people to deviate."
  * "The important question is not 'why do people not obey the rules of society,' but 'why do people obey the rules of society'?" (Inderbitzen et al. 2017:272)
* *Most deviant behavior is the result of insufficient control*
  * "Control theories assume that delinquent acts result when an individual's bond to society is weak or broken" (172).
  * The 'bond' can be measured by the *strength of one's attachment to conventional society*
* "A Control Theory of Delinquency," by Travis Hirschi
  * Strength of *attachment* to conventional significant others serves to 'control' an individual's impulse to behave in deviant - or non-conforming - ways
  * The risk of losing the approval of rule-abiding significant others limits behavior to conventional lines
  * Strength of *commitment* to conventional lines of action is a function of 'protecting assets'
  * "Most people, simply in the process of living in organized society, acquire goods, reputations, prospects that they do not want to risk losing.  These accumulations are society's insurance that they will abide by the rules" (175).
  * Strength of *involvement* in conventional activities limits the 'opportunity' to behave deviantly
  * "A person may be simply too busy doing conventional things to find the time to engage in devian behavior."
  * "Many persons undoubtably owe a life of virtue to a lack of opportunity to do otherwise." (175).
  * Strength of *belief* in conventional rules and activities also 'controls' the impulse to act devaintly
  * "There is variation in the extent to which people believe they should obey the rules of society" (178).
  * "The less a person believes he should obey the rules, the more likely he is to violate them" (178).
