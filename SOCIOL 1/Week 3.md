## Microsociology
* The study of everyday behavior in situations of small-scale face-to-face interaction" (Giddens et al. 2020:25)
* Erving Goffman and Harold Garfinkel developed two popular microsociological approaches
### Erving Goffman (1922 - 1982) and Copresence
* "Goffman's genius lies in exploring how the physical copresence of individuals... shapes the organization of the self" (A&E 2016:257)
* The "self" is composed of many 'selves' - each of which correspond to different roles and audiences.

---

* In *The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life* (1959), Goffman analyzed the 'interaction order'
* Social interaction is an orderly affair - there is a 'structure' to social encounters
* A condition of '**copresence**' (i.e., the presence of two or more people) initiates the interaction order
  * Copresence takes one of two forms:
    * "*Unfocused* interaction takes place whenever individuals exhibit awareness of one another's presence" (e.g., crowds) (Giddens et al. 2020:143)
    * "*Focused* interaction occurs when individuals directly attent to what others say and do" (i.e., encounters).
  * Whether under the conditions of 'unfocused' or 'focused' interaction...
  * Goffman argues that individuals strive to influence the perceptions of others by engaging in the 'arts of impression management'
#### Q: What is "impression management"?
* The strategic actions 'performed' by a person to convey an acceptable and favorable image of oneself to others
* Individuals are 'actors' - playing 'parts' in the various 'scenes' of everyday life for attentive 'audiences'
* "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players" - Shakespeare
  * Dramaturgical Sociology
    * *Social life* is a *theoretical production* - it involves front-stages, back-stages, scenes, roles, performances, props, and most importantly, audiences.
    * Knowing which 'self' a person is obliged to perform requires knowledge of the "scene"
* "Definition of the situation"
  * "Preliminary to any self-determined act of behavior there is always a stage of... deliberation which we may call the definition of the situation" (258).
  * "Goffman looks to the *scene* within which individuals orient their actions to one another" (A&E 2016:257)
* **Front-stage**
  * The part of the social world where social performances are idealized and conform to the 'stereotyped expectations' of audiences
  * E.g., 'Classroom' as a *formal scene* - the behavior of participants is scripted, conforming to expectations
* **Back-stage**
  * "The part of the social world where people feel free to express themselves in ways that are suppressed in the front stage" (Ritzer 2015:152)
  * "Here the performer can relax; he can drop his front, forgo speaking his lines, and step out of character."
  * Behavior is influenced by the type of audience.
* Audience Segregation
  * "In each of their roles, they act somewhat differently, and they try to keep what they do in each role distinct from what they do in their other roles."
  * "This means they can have multiple selves" (138) - which may be consistent or inconsistent.
* "Regardless of the particular objective which the individual has in mind... it will be in [their\] interests to control the conduct of others especially their responsive treatment of [oneself\]" (39)
  * For example, you would spend time in the bathroom (backstage) to prepare your presentation for going out (front stage)
#### Q: Why do we attempt to 'control the conduct of others' through impression management?
* Self-interest (offensive motivatioh)
  * We are cunning, calculating actors striving to portray ourselves in the most favorable light possible in order to *maximize rewards*
  * There is a *profitability* to strong performances
* Self-protection (defensive motivation)
  * "The self is a sacred object... it must be treated with proper ritual care and in turn must be presented in a proper light to others."
  * **Q:** What is at stake?
    * What is at stake is 'face' - the positive social value a person effectively claims for oneself.
    * "People are intensively attuned to what others think of them and how others view them."
    * "Seeking approval and respect, individuals want to 'save face' at every turn" (Giddens et al. 2020:136)
    * "A central insight... based on Goffman's work is that every human being possesses a self that is fragile and vulnerable to embarrassment... or even humiliation, at every turn" (136).
    * *Good performances* generate feelings of dignity, whereas *poor performances* produce feelings of shame
  * Goffman argues:
    * "The process by which a self is achieved involves an actor choosing to perform an identified self while *other persons either ratify the performance or not*" (Rawls 2010)
    * 'Selves' and 'identities' must be endorsed by others
    * The '*self*' is a *performed character* - it is the dramatic product of our interactions with various audiences
    * "The characteristic issue, the crucial concern, is whether it will be credited or discredited"
    * *Self-identity* is realized in performance - other *must* ratify performances to validate identity-claims
* Presentation of 'cyber-self' in everyday life
  * The internet has created a new and distinctive social domain for human interaction
  * It is qualitatively different from traditional conditions of face-to-face interaction - e.g., *embodied copresence*, performative, synchronously situated with defined audiences
