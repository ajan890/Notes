# Week 3
## Microsociology
* The study of everyday behavior in situations of small-scale face-to-face interaction" (Giddens et al. 2020:25)
* Erving Goffman and Harold Garfinkel developed two popular microsociological approaches
### Erving Goffman (1922 - 1982) and Copresence
* "Goffman's genius lies in exploring how the physical copresence of individuals... shapes the organization of the self" (A&E 2016:257)
* The "self" is composed of many 'selves' - each of which correspond to different roles and audiences.

---

* In *The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life* (1959), Goffman analyzed the 'interaction order'
* Social interaction is an orderly affair - there is a 'structure' to social encounters
* A condition of '**copresence**' (i.e., the presence of two or more people) initiates the interaction order
  * Copresence takes one of two forms:
    * "*Unfocused* interaction takes place whenever individuals exhibit awareness of one another's presence" (e.g., crowds) (Giddens et al. 2020:143)
    * "*Focused* interaction occurs when individuals directly attent to what others say and do" (i.e., encounters).
  * Whether under the conditions of 'unfocused' or 'focused' interaction...
  * Goffman argues that individuals strive to influence the perceptions of others by engaging in the 'arts of impression management'
#### Q: What is "impression management"?
* The strategic actions 'performed' by a person to convey an acceptable and favorable image of oneself to others
* Individuals are 'actors' - playing 'parts' in the various 'scenes' of everyday life for attentive 'audiences'
* "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players" - Shakespeare
  * Dramaturgical Sociology
    * *Social life* is a *theoretical production* - it involves front-stages, back-stages, scenes, roles, performances, props, and most importantly, audiences.
    * Knowing which 'self' a person is obliged to perform requires knowledge of the "scene"
* "Definition of the situation"
  * "Preliminary to any self-determined act of behavior there is always a stage of... deliberation which we may call the definition of the situation" (258).
  * "Goffman looks to the *scene* within which individuals orient their actions to one another" (A&E 2016:257)
* **Front-stage**
  * The part of the social world where social performances are idealized and conform to the 'stereotyped expectations' of audiences
  * E.g., 'Classroom' as a *formal scene* - the behavior of participants is scripted, conforming to expectations
* **Back-stage**
  * "The part of the social world where people feel free to express themselves in ways that are suppressed in the front stage" (Ritzer 2015:152)
  * "Here the performer can relax; he can drop his front, forgo speaking his lines, and step out of character."
  * Behavior is influenced by the type of audience.
* Audience Segregation
  * "In each of their roles, they act somewhat differently, and they try to keep what they do in each role distinct from what they do in their other roles."
  * "This means they can have multiple selves" (138) - which may be consistent or inconsistent.
* "Regardless of the particular objective which the individual has in mind... it will be in [their\] interests to control the conduct of others especially their responsive treatment of [oneself\]" (39)
  * For example, you would spend time in the bathroom (backstage) to prepare your presentation for going out (front stage)
#### Q: Why do we attempt to 'control the conduct of others' through impression management?
* Self-interest (offensive motivatioh)
  * We are cunning, calculating actors striving to portray ourselves in the most favorable light possible in order to *maximize rewards*
  * There is a *profitability* to strong performances
* Self-protection (defensive motivation)
  * "The self is a sacred object... it must be treated with proper ritual care and in turn must be presented in a proper light to others."
  * **Q:** What is at stake?
    * What is at stake is 'face' - the positive social value a person effectively claims for oneself.
    * "People are intensively attuned to what others think of them and how others view them."
    * "Seeking approval and respect, individuals want to 'save face' at every turn" (Giddens et al. 2020:136)
    * "A central insight... based on Goffman's work is that every human being possesses a self that is fragile and vulnerable to embarrassment... or even humiliation, at every turn" (136).
    * *Good performances* generate feelings of dignity, whereas *poor performances* produce feelings of shame
  * Goffman argues:
    * "The process by which a self is achieved involves an actor choosing to perform an identified self while *other persons either ratify the performance or not*" (Rawls 2010)
    * 'Selves' and 'identities' must be endorsed by others
    * The '*self*' is a *performed character* - it is the dramatic product of our interactions with various audiences
    * "The characteristic issue, the crucial concern, is whether it will be credited or discredited"
    * *Self-identity* is realized in performance - other *must* ratify performances to validate identity-claims
* Presentation of 'cyber-self' in everyday life
  * The internet has created a new and distinctive social domain for human interaction
  * It is qualitatively different from traditional conditions of face-to-face interaction - e.g., *embodied copresence*, performative, synchronously situated with defined audiences

### Cyber-self In Everyday Life
* The internet has created a new and distinctive social domain for social interaction
* It is qualitatively different from traditional conditions of face-to-face interaction - e.g., *embodied copresence*, perofrmative, synchronously situated with defined audiences
* **Q:** How has cyberspace - as a type of social context - altered the conditions of self-presentation?
* **Q:** Are Goffman's ideas still useful for understanding self-presentation in the virtual world?
* **Q:** If so, how do individuals engage in the 'arts of impression management' in a virtual environment?
* "Identity Construction on Facebook," by Shanyang Zhao, Sherri Grasmuch and Jason Martin
  * 2023: 70% of adult Americans report using the social media platform Facebook 0 and globally, there are 2.9 billion monthly active Facebook users
  * **Q:** What explains Facebook's popularity?
  * *Facebook is a powerful resource for self-presentation*
  * The "Facebook environment provides users with new leverage for selective self-presentation" (1821)
  * It supplies individuals with a highly controllable or manageable digital context for constructing desirable online identities
  * It enables indibiduals to exercise *far greater control* over the disclosure of personal information
  * Since Facebook is considered a '*nonymous*' online world, in which social relationships are anchored in offline communities...
  * Favorable displays can accrue rewards
#### *Facebook empowers self-presentation*; i.e., the ability to convey a favorable image to others
* Visual: Self as Social Actor
  * Photos depict users in the company of friends, mostly smiling, having fun, and expressing affection (mean number of photos per user = 88.4)
  * 'Watch me and know me by my friends,' is an effort to construct a group-oriented identity
* Enumerate: Self as Consumer
  * Users list cultural preferences and tastes, interests and hobbies that 'define the self'
  * "Greatest enumeration came with *music* preferences with users listing an average of 8.3 songs, artists, or genres per person as their favorites' (1825).
* Narrative: First Person Self
  * "Explicit verbal descriptions of the self" were *least elaborated* by users, offering minimalist statements
  * E.g., 'I'm laid back,' 'What you see is what you get, 50% of the time,' or 'Currently in Zen mode'
* "'True selves,' 'real selves,' and 'hoped-for possible selves' are products of *different situations* rather than characteristics of different individuals" (1831)
* "Identity is not an indiidual characteristic; it is not an expression of something innate in a person, it is rather a social product, the outcome of a given *social environment* and hence *performed* differently in varying contexts" (1831)

#### "The Girl Hunt," by David Grazian
* **Q:** What is the 'girl hunt'?  How does this activity involve the 'performance' of an identity?
* The 'girl hunt' involves groups of single, heterosexual young men going out to public venues to pursue female sexual partners with the intent of 'hooking-up'
* The 'pickup' is statistically improbable
  * Only 5.5% of women actually 'hook-up' within two days of meeting a male partner
* Instead, the 'girl hunt' is about *homosocial conduct*, or building camaraderie with male friends
* **Ritualistic performance:**
  * "It is a social drama through which young men *perform* their interpretation of manhood" (230) - in the company of other young men
  * 'Pre-gaming' and 'hunting' performances promote male bonding and camaraderie.

## Ethnomethodology
* Refers to the "study of the ethnomethods - fold or lay methods - that people use to make sense of what others do and particularly of what they say."
* 'Ethno' = people. 'method' = systematic procedure, 'ology' = study of
* Garfinkel argues that sociologists must address how people *make* sense of their realities
* Social order - the organization of collective activity - requires 'sense making' procedures
* One of the most central features of the organization of social activity is 'intelligibility'
* **Q:** "How do social actors come to know, and know in common, what they are doing and the circumstances in which they are doing it?" (Heritage 1984:76)
  * According to Garfinkel, intelligibility is achieved through the use of various sense-making procedures
  * One impotant procedure is called 'indexicality'
  * Words are only approximate and indeterminate
  * "The words used in ordinary talk do not always have precise meanings" (giddens et al. 2020:149).
  * Garfinkel found that people draw upon their immediate 'social ontexts' to determine the specific meaning of descriptive utterances
 
* "Indexicality" is a cooperative sense-making method
* "Individuals must actively perform contextualizing work in order to see what the descriptions used in encounters mean" (Heritage 1984:363).
* "It is by virtue of our contextualizing activities as *hearers* that, as *speakers*, we can make good sense."
* We assume - in everyday life - that people will engage in such forms of 'accommodative work'
* People 'trust' that others will try to make sense of their communications according to the "background expectancies" of daily life
* Trust implies that 'intelligibility' is a moral matter.
* 'Breaching experiments'
  * These refer to demonstrations designed to 'disrupt normal procedures,' i.e., defy expectations of cooperative, accommodative sense-making work
  * Without fail, these experiments led to 'righteous hostility' on behalf of the offended
  * E.g., Conversation clarification experiment
    > S: "How are you?<br>
    > E: "How am I in regard to what? My health, my finances, my school work, my peace of mind, my...?<br>
    > S: (red in the face and suddenly out of control): Look! I was just trying to be polite.  Frankly, I don't give a damn how you are.<br>
    * "If someone said, 'Have a nice day,' the student was to respond, 'Nice in what sense, exactly?' 'Which part of the day do you mean?'" (Giddens et al. 2020:149).
* 'Boarder (or stranger) experiment'
  * Students were instructed to interact with their family members as if they were boarders and not intimates
  * "They were instructed to conduct themselves in a... polite fashion... to avoid getting personal, to use only formal address."
    * Family members were first stupefied, before quickly becoming angry and upset, followed by withdrawal, denunciation or retaliation
* **Q:** Why is this sociologically significant?
  * The response of 'righteous hostility' reveals the moral foundation of the social order
  * People trust that others will comply with the 'background expectancies' of everyday life - to cooperate in the production of intelligible action
