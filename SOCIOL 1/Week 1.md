# Week 1

## What is Sociology?
* It is a 'field of knowledge' derived from the scientific and systematic study of human society.
* Human societies are composed of social groups, cultural systems and social institutions - all of which are products of human interaction.
* Focus is on the 'collectivity' - *primacy of the group*.
  * For sociologists, the most important unit of analysis is the group.
  * In contrast, psychologists focus on the individual.
* As a 'science', the objective is to arrive at empirically verifiable, causal explanations of human behavior
  * The fundamental question: *'Why do people do what they do?'*
* All varieties of human behavior are regarded as having 'causes and effects' *sociological research seeks to uncover the reasons for their incidence*

## Origins of Sociology
* Auguste Comte (1798 - 1857), French
* 'Socio' comes from the Latin word 'Socius' (meaning 'companion') + 'ology' (meaning 'subject of study')
* Comte viewed the *social world* - like the natural world - as governed by universal laws, discoverable through empirical observation and verification
* Comte published *The Positive Philosophy* (1830 - 1842)
  * The 'Law of Three Stages': Societies evolve by passing through successive stages, the (i) theological stage, (ii) metaphysical stage and (iii) positive stage.
    * Theology: religion, etc.
    * Metaphysical: philosophy, etc.
    * Positive: scientific, etc.

### Q: Why did Comte advocate for using the scientific method to study society?
* Historical context: France, 18th and 19th centuries
  * Political crises and social instability plagued French society throughout Comte's lifetime
  * French Revolution (1789), Napoleon I staged a *coup d'etat* (1799) crowning himself emperor (1804) and Napoleon III staged a second *coup d'etat* (1851)
  * Yet, scientists had made tremendous advancements...
  * Why can't we use science to discover ways to fix this?
* As a result, the original objective of sociology was to use the scientific method to discover the 'fundamental laws of human organization'
* Society can then be organized on the basis of these laws and principles (not on religious beliefs, superstitions and metaphysical abstractions!)...
* In order to 'bring harmony to the social system.'
* This aspiration reflected a broader cultural shift - a new cultural attitude: 'Modernism'
* A repudiation of traditional beliefs and values in favor of contemporary ones - scientific rationalism, liberalism, and progressive ideals
  * 'The future can be better than the past'

### Q: What remains of 19th century sociological ambitions?
* Very few contemporary sociologists seek to uncover 'universal laws' of human behavior - research today is far more specialized (e.g., areas of concentration, aspects of society)
* However, the belief that sociological knowledge can promote human well-being persists.

#### In Modern Sociology
* Basic research: The goal of sociologists is to "figure out what the social world is like and why it works as it does" (Schutt 2019:20) - i.e., the 'knowledge for its own sale' approach
* Applied research: The goal of sociologists is to find solutions to societal problems - 'to change the current state of social life for the better' (Zevallos 2009)

### Q: What is the *promise* of 'sociological imagination'?
> "According to Mills, each of us lives in a veryu small orbit, and our worldview is limited by the social situations we encounter on a daily basis... We all go through life with a certain limited perspective..." (Giddens et al. 2020:6) <br>
* Which restricts our consciousness and awareness

* The "sociological imagination' - a unique quality of mind - however, "allows its possessor to understand the *larger historical scene...*" (3)
* To grasp the *connections* between the individual and society, biography and history, self and world
* Individuals *within* societies, societies *within* history
* Perhaps the greatest promise of this 'quality of mind' is found in its problem-solving potential
* The sociological imagination orients minds to better understand 'issues' - or 'public matters'
* Mills urges us to "consider unemployment... consider war... consider marriage" (6).
  * When unemployment spikes, when nations go to war, when half of marriages end in divorce...
  * These are not merely 'personal troubles' - they are symptomatic of deeper structural issues
  * We must therefore look beyond the 'private orbits of individuals' to institutional and cultural realities.
* Great Recession: An unemployment rate of 10% (2009) cannot be explained by 'personality traits'
  * E.g., Character, work ethic, disposition, etc.
* It requires an 'institutional' explanation - "the very structure of opportunities has collapsed" (5) as a result of failed financial and governmental policies
* When in a nation of 325 miillion people, 40"% of first marriages end in divorce...
  * This is not a 'private trouble,' it's a 'public issue'
* It requires an analysis of cultural and institutional factors - e.g., family law, financial autonomy, spousal expectations occupational demands, etc.

## Modern theoretical approaches within sociology
* Also referred to as *perspectives*, paradigms or traditions, these schools of thought are indispensable for the cultavation of a 'socialogical imagination'
* Functionalism, conflict theory and sympolic interactionism are three influential approaches.

### Functionalism
* Emile Durkheim (1858-1917)
* Functionalists conceive of human society as a 'social system' organized to sustain communal living
* "To study the function of a social activity is to analyze its contribution to the continuation of society as a whole" (Giddens et al. 2020:20)
* The fundamental question of functionalism: 'What leads to social solidarity and stability?'
  * 'Social solidarity' refers to the "bonds that unite the members of a social group" (Eglitis and Chambliss 2019:13)

### Conflict Theory
* Karl Marx (1818-1883)
* Conflict theorists conceive of human society as a 'site of struggle' organized around the control of valued resources (e.g., wealth, status, and power)
* They "underscore the role of coercion and power in producing social order" (Giddens et al. 2020:21)
* The fundamental question of conflict theory: 'Who benefits from the way social institutions and cultural systems are run?'

## Culture
* Culture encompasses a wide variety of symbolic mediums and material objects that allow a group of people to carry out their collective lives in a relative order and harmony (Ritzer 2015:109)
  * **Symbolic** (or nonmaterial) culture refers to a society's values, beliefs, norms, symbols, and language
  * **Material** culture consists of "the physical objects that a society creates" (Giddens et al. 2020:62)
* "The first evdence of humanlike culture dates back 2 million years" (Giddens et al. 2020:68)
* The origin or emergence of culture may be best explained by the advantages it provided humans for adapting to their physical environments
* Human survival necessitated cultural invention
* For example, the creation of symbolic and material resources - such as language and weaponry - assisted humans in hunting wild game
  * Linguistic coordination and lethal instruments
  * "Culture enabled early humans to compensate for their physical limitations..." (e.g., lack of claws)
### Material Culture Then and Now
* The first elements of material culture included tools, garments, blankets, baskets, pottery and shelters
* Today's material culture includes "consumer goods, from clothes to cars to houses," along with "the tools and technologies used to make those goods" (66).
* Material culture also changes symbolic culture.
  * Modern 'digital culture' is sustained by smartphones.
  * Computers have fundamentally altered how people communicate or interact with each other and society, to the point where the new norm to talking to someone is sending a text message.
  * Cities like Los Angeles are completely built around the automobile.  There now exists "car culture."
  * Fashion culture, music culture, etc. are entirely dependent on materials that exist.
 ### Language
 * Language plays an essential role in human cultures
 * "Language is involved in virtually all our activities... it is the means by which we organize most of what we do" (Giddens et al. 2020:64)
 * "There is no known culture without a grammatically complex language..." (61) (i.ie., "cultural universal")
   * **"Cultural universal"** means every culture has it.  All groups of human beings has some language to communicate with.
* "Languages... are representations of reality" (65)
* Every language is composed of 'symbols' - expressed in speech (sound) and writing (text) - for this purpose of communicating meanings and ideas
* Symbols refer to things that represent or stand for something else (e.g., words or a national flag)
* Through the medium of language, people articulate common values, beliefs, and norms

### Values
* "Values are abstract ideals" (62)
* They refer to the relative worth or importance that people assign to things (e.g., the value placed on individual achievement)
* **Values are often closely associated with beliefs**
* Beliefs refer to understandings or judgments that people accept as 'true' or 'real'
* E.g., American culture "reflects a particular range of values shared by many... such as the **belief** in the merits of individual achievement..." (62)
* Values and beliefs sustain the "normative order"
  * "Norms are principles or rules of social life that everyone is expected to observe" (63).
  * Communal living requires the presence of shared 'behavioral expectations' for directing and organizing social behavior (e.g., libraries are quiet places)

### Conformity
* "All cultures serve as an important source of conformity" (77).
* "One of the challenges for all cultures is to instill in people a willingness to conform" (78)
* This is accomplished through **social learning** (i.e., socialization) and social control (i.e., sanctioning)
  * Socialization is the process in which you learn the culture of your society.
### Q: Where do cultural realities come from?  Who decides what to value, what to believe, and what is acceptable behavior?
  * Sociologists argue that culture is based on consensus.
  * 'Shared agreements' determine what is factual, what is real and what is true.

#### Example: Food culture
* Food culture refers to "what we eat, when we eat, how we eat, and why we eat" (G&W 2008:5)
* **Q:** How is what you eat and consume shaped by shared agreements regarding what is appropriate for human consumption?
  * Example: Cultural variability in treatment of dogs:
    * "In American culture, dogs are typically regarded as household pets and lavished with affection.  In Guatemalan Indian culture, however, dogs are more often seen as guards or scavengers and are treated with an indifference that might be seen as cruel to Americans.  Among the Ahka of northern Thailand, dogs are seen as food, and they are treated accordingly" (65).
* "... Despite similar physiological needs in humans, food habits are not universal, natural, or inevitable.".
* "They are social constructions" (G&W 2008:4)
* "... Food habits are learnt through culturally determined notions of what constitutes appropriate and inappropriate food."

---

* "Things are true if we agree they are" (Babbie 1986)
* For this reason, human cultures exhibit astonishing variation across time (history) and space (geography)
* Religious cultures, political cultures, economic cultures, and 'food cultures' are sustained by people's acceptance of shared values, beliefs, and norms.
