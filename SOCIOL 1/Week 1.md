# Week 1

## What is Sociology?
* It is a 'field of knowledge' derived from the scientific and systematic study of human society.
* Human societies are composed of social groups, cultural systems and social institutions - all of which are products of human interaction.
* Focus is on the 'collectivity' - *primacy of the group*.
  * For sociologists, the most important unit of analysis is the group.
  * In contrast, psychologists focus on the individual.
* As a 'science', the objective is to arrive at empirically verifiable, causal explanations of human behavior
  * The fundamental question: *'Why do people do what they do?'*
* All varieties of human behavior are regarded as having 'causes and effects' *sociological research seeks to uncover the reasons for their incidence*

## Origins of Sociology
* Auguste Comte (1798 - 1857), French
* 'Socio' comes from the Latin word 'Socius' (meaning 'companion') + 'ology' (meaning 'subject of study')
* Comte viewed the *social world* - like the natural world - as governed by universal laws, discoverable through empirical observation and verification
* Comte published *The Positive Philosophy* (1830 - 1842)
  * The 'Law of Three Stages': Societies evolve by passing through successive stages, the (i) theological stage, (ii) metaphysical stage and (iii) positive stage.
    * Theology: religion, etc.
    * Metaphysical: philosophy, etc.
    * Positive: scientific, etc.

### Q: Why did Comte advocate for using the scientific method to study society?
* Historical context: France, 18th and 19th centuries
  * Political crises and social instability plagued French society throughout Comte's lifetime
  * French Revolution (1789), Napoleon I staged a *coup d'etat* (1799) crowning himself emperor (1804) and Napoleon III staged a second *coup d'etat* (1851)
  * Yet, scientists had made tremendous advancements...
  * Why can't we use science to discover ways to fix this?
* As a result, the original objective of sociology was to use the scientific method to discover the 'fundamental laws of human organization'
* Society can then be organized on the basis of these laws and principles (not on religious beliefs, superstitions and metaphysical abstractions!)...
* In order to 'bring harmony to the social system.'
* This aspiration reflected a broader cultural shift - a new cultural attitude: 'Modernism'
* A repudiation of traditional beliefs and values in favor of contemporary ones - scientific rationalism, liberalism, and progressive ideals
  * 'The future can be better than the past'

### Q: What remains of 19th century sociological ambitions?
* Very few contemporary sociologists seek to uncover 'universal laws' of human behavior - research today is far more specialized (e.g., areas of concentration, aspects of society)
* However, the belief that sociological knowledge can promote human well-being persists.

#### In Modern Sociology
* Basic research: The goal of sociologists is to "figure out what the social world is like and why it works as it does" (Schutt 2019:20) - i.e., the 'knowledge for its own sale' approach
* Applied research: The goal of sociologists is to find solutions to societal problems - 'to change the current state of social life for the better' (Zevallos 2009)

### Q: What is the *promise* of 'sociological imagination'?
> "According to Mills, each of us lives in a veryu small orbit, and our worldview is limited by the social situations we encounter on a daily basis... We all go through life with a certain limited perspective..." (Giddens et al. 2020:6) <br>
* Which restricts our consciousness and awareness

* The "sociological imagination' - a unique quality of mind - however, "allows its possessor to understand the *larger historical scene...*" (3)
* To grasp the *connections* between the individual and society, biography and history, self and world
* Individuals *within* societies, societies *within* history
* Perhaps the greatest promise of this 'quality of mind' is found in its problem-solving potential
* The sociological imagination orients minds to better understand 'issues' - or 'public matters'
* Mills urges us to "consider unemployment... consider war... consider marriage" (6).
  * When unemployment spikes, when nations go to war, when half of marriages end in divorce...
  * These are not merely 'personal troubles' - they are symptomatic of deeper structural issues
  * We must therefore look beyond the 'private orbits of individuals' to institutional and cultural realities.
* Great Recession: An unemployment rate of 10% (2009) cannot be explained by 'personality traits'
  * E.g., Character, work ethic, disposition, etc.
* It requires an 'institutional' explanation - "the very structure of opportunities has collapsed" (5) as a result of failed financial and governmental policies
* When in a nation of 325 miillion people, 40"% of first marriages end in divorce...
  * This is not a 'private trouble,' it's a 'public issue'
* It requires an analysis of cultural and institutional factors - e.g., family law, financial autonomy, spousal expectations occupational demands, etc.

## Modern theoretical approaches within sociology
* Also referred to as *perspectives*, paradigms or traditions, these schools of thought are indispensable for the cultavation of a 'socialogical imagination'
* Functionalism, conflict theory and sympolic interactionism are three influential approaches.

### Functionalism
* Emile Durkheim (1858-1917)
* Functionalists conceive of human society as a 'social system' organized to sustain communal living
* "To study the function of a social activity is to analyze its contribution to the continuation of society as a whole" (Giddens et al. 2020:20)
* The fundamental question of functionalism: 'What leads to social solidarity and stability?'
  * 'Social solidarity' refers to the "bonds that unite the members of a social group" (Eglitis and Chambliss 2019:13)

### Conflict Theory
* Karl Marx (1818-1883)
* Conflict theorists conceive of human society as a 'site of struggle' organized around the control of valued resources (e.g., wealth, status, and power)
* They "underscore the role of coercion and power in producing social order" (Giddens et al. 2020:21)
* The fundamental question of conflict theory: 'Who benefits from the way social institutions and cultural systems are run?'
