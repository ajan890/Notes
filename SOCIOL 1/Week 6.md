## Social Institutions
### Education
* Education refers to the "process of receiving or giving systematic instruction, especially at a school or university."
* "Until the first few decades of the 19th century, most of the world's population had no schooling whatsoever.
* Educational systems are very modern institutions
* The instruction of pupils within schools accompanied the processes of industrialization and urbanization
* "As the industrial economy rapidly expanded... there was a great demand for specialized schooling that could produce [FILL]"
* "In modern societies, people have to be furnished with basic competencies - such as reading writing, and calculating..." (379)
* These competences are cultivated by a basic curriculum of language, history, math, and science.
* Endowing a population with standard literacies.
* Important to sociologists are the broader social functions played by schools
* "We discuss three major sociological theories of the role schooling plays in the larger society" (618).
* Schooling as 'assimilation,' schooling as 'credentialing' and schooling as 'social reproduction'
* These perspectives differ widely on the extent to which education functions as an 'equalizer'
* "Education... is a great equalizer of conditions of men - the balance wheel of the social machinery."
* **Q:** Do schools in the U.S. offer students equal chances and opportunities to succeed?
* Functionalists emphasize the 'assimilation function'
  * "Schools are the official agency for passing on [society's] prevailing values" (382).
  * "Learning a common language and the facts of a common history... create a sense of 'affinity among members of a society'" (Gidden et al. 2020:618)
  * The father of American scholarship and education - Noah Webster (1758 - 1843) - viewed 'national cohesion; as public schooling's greatest aim:
    * According to E.D. Hirsch Jr., "Webster rightly understood that a common language and its shared values learned in school were just as important to the success of the new nation as its Constitution and formal laws" (2020:18).
  * "First, schools encourage independence... Second, schools teach children to value achievement."
  * "Third, schools are universalistic, treating children as members of general social categories...".
  * "Fourth, schools teach the norm of specificity"... focusing on "specific aspects of a given student" (360).
  * Schooling serves an important socializing function by cultivating a strong sense of 'commonality'
  * "School systems are at worst benign institutions and at best highly positive systems... Necessary to the successful functioning of society and to individual success" (Ritzer 2016:360)
* "A second influential perspective is credentialism."
  * Conflict theorists see "education as central to a status competition among groups within society."
  * While credentials are normally valued as evidence of career readiness (e.g., knowledge and skills), conflict theorists view them as limiting social mobility.
  * According to Randall Collins (1979), "as low- and high-status groups both pursued upward mobility..."
  * High-status groups maintained their social position by acquiring more education and more educational credentials" (Ritzer 2016:361).
  * Credentials limit access to high-status positions
  * Through 'social closure,' credentialism leads to the exclusion of low-status group members
  * Jobs that require credentials restrict the employment opportunities of the 'uncredentialed'...
  * Making it difficult for low-status groups to improve their social position to higher-paying occupations
  * A third perspective on the role of schooling - also rooted in conflict theory...
  * Is referred to as 'social reproduction'
  * [FILL]
  * Conflict theorists argue "that the hidden curriculum is the mechanism through which social reproduction occurs" (619)
  * Mass education serves employers by producing the traits and personalities desired in workers:
    * Obedient, self-disciplined, dependable, punctual, etc.
  * [FILL]
  * Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis (1976) argue that "modern... [FILL]
  * "Students from wealthier backgrounds take college-prep courses... while their classmates from more disadvantaged backgrounds are tracked into vocational programs."
  * "Schools... tend to teach students an uncritical acceptance of the existing social order" (620).
  * [FILL]
  * 'Tracking' divides students into groups based on [FILL]
  * Indeed, research indicates that while "tracking does have positive benefits for 'advanced' students..."
  * It "reinforces previously existing inequalities for average or poor students" (627).
  * 'Cumulative advantage': "The most advanced individuals are awarded the best opportunities..." (292).
  * Other sociologists have researched the stark disparities in the conditions of American schooling
  * Jonathan Kozol provides journalistic accounts of the inequalities existing across different school districts
  * Inadequate school facilities and programs, violence, discipline problems, low retention of quality teachers
  * "Because school funding tends to come from local property taxes, wealthier areas generate mory funding for schools... while poorer neighborhoods with few lavish provate homes have far less money for schools" (626).
  * This leads to discrepancies in the quality of education.
  * According to the National Center for Education Statistics, "in school year 2019-20, elementary and secondary public school revenues totaled $871 billion, (in constant 2021-22 dollars)."
  * [FILL]
  * In 2019-2020, 92% of public school funding came from state and local revenues; 8% from federal revenue
  * Differences in property taxes create disparities in local revenues for public schools
  * Per pupil spending varies by district: $10987 versus $31491 per child across school districts in Chicago
  * Kozol maintains that the quality of a K-12 education impacts academic performance:
  * Which has been shown to influence:
    1. Level of educational attainment
    2. Personal income
    3. Accumulation of wealth
