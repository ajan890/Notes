## Social Institutions
### Education
* Education refers to the "process of receiving or giving systematic instruction, especially at a school or university."
* "Until the first few decades of the 19th century, most of the world's population had no schooling whatsoever.
* Educational systems are very modern institutions
* The instruction of pupils within schools accompanied the processes of industrialization and urbanization
* "As the industrial economy rapidly expanded... there was a great demand for specialized schooling that could produce [FILL]"
* "In modern societies, people have to be furnished with basic competencies - such as reading writing, and calculating..." (379)
* These competences are cultivated by a basic curriculum of language, history, math, and science.
* Endowing a population with standard literacies.
* Important to sociologists are the broader social functions played by schools
* "We discuss three major sociological theories of the role schooling plays in the larger society" (618).
* Schooling as 'assimilation,' schooling as 'credentialing' and schooling as 'social reproduction'
* These perspectives differ widely on the extent to which education functions as an 'equalizer'
* "Education... is a great equalizer of conditions of men - the balance wheel of the social machinery."
* **Q:** Do schools in the U.S. offer students equal chances and opportunities to succeed?
* Functionalists emphasize the 'assimilation function'
  * "Schools are the official agency for passing on [society's] prevailing values" (382).
  * "Learning a common language and the facts of a common history... create a sense of 'affinity among members of a society'" (Gidden et al. 2020:618)
  * The father of American scholarship and education - Noah Webster (1758 - 1843) - viewed 'national cohesion; as public schooling's greatest aim:
    * According to E.D. Hirsch Jr., "Webster rightly understood that a common language and its shared values learned in school were just as important to the success of the new nation as its Constitution and formal laws" (2020:18).
  * "First, schools encourage independence... Second, schools teach children to value achievement."
  * "Third, schools are universalistic, treating children as members of general social categories...".
  * "Fourth, schools teach the norm of specificity"... focusing on "specific aspects of a given student" (360).
  * Schooling serves an important socializing function by cultivating a strong sense of 'commonality'
  * "School systems are at worst benign institutions and at best highly positive systems... Necessary to the successful functioning of society and to individual success" (Ritzer 2016:360)
* "A second influential perspective is credentialism."
  * Conflict theorists see "education as central to a status competition among groups within society."
  * While credentials are normally valued as evidence of career readiness (e.g., knowledge and skills), conflict theorists view them as limiting social mobility.
  * According to Randall Collins (1979), "as low- and high-status groups both pursued upward mobility..."
  * High-status groups maintained their social position by acquiring more education and more educational credentials" (Ritzer 2016:361).
  * Credentials limit access to high-status positions
  * Through 'social closure,' credentialism leads to the exclusion of low-status group members
  * Jobs that require credentials restrict the employment opportunities of the 'uncredentialed'...
  * Making it difficult for low-status groups to improve their social position to higher-paying occupations
  * A third perspective on the role of schooling - also rooted in conflict theory...
  * Is referred to as 'social reproduction'
  * [FILL]
  * Conflict theorists argue "that the hidden curriculum is the mechanism through which social reproduction occurs" (619)
  * Mass education serves employers by producing the traits and personalities desired in workers:
    * Obedient, self-disciplined, dependable, punctual, etc.
  * [FILL]
  * Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis (1976) argue that "modern... [FILL]
  * "Students from wealthier backgrounds take college-prep courses... while their classmates from more disadvantaged backgrounds are tracked into vocational programs."
  * "Schools... tend to teach students an uncritical acceptance of the existing social order" (620).
  * [FILL]
  * 'Tracking' divides students into groups based on [FILL]
  * Indeed, research indicates that while "tracking does have positive benefits for 'advanced' students..."
  * It "reinforces previously existing inequalities for average or poor students" (627).
  * 'Cumulative advantage': "The most advanced individuals are awarded the best opportunities..." (292).
  * Other sociologists have researched the stark disparities in the conditions of American schooling
  * Jonathan Kozol provides journalistic accounts of the inequalities existing across different school districts
  * Inadequate school facilities and programs, violence, discipline problems, low retention of quality teachers
  * "Because school funding tends to come from local property taxes, wealthier areas generate mory funding for schools... while poorer neighborhoods with few lavish provate homes have far less money for schools" (626).
  * This leads to discrepancies in the quality of education.
  * According to the National Center for Education Statistics, "in school year 2019-20, elementary and secondary public school revenues totaled $871 billion, (in constant 2021-22 dollars)."
  * [FILL]
  * In 2019-2020, 92% of public school funding came from state and local revenues; 8% from federal revenue
  * Differences in property taxes create disparities in local revenues for public schools
  * Per pupil spending varies by district: $10987 versus $31491 per child across school districts in Chicago
  * Kozol maintains that the quality of a K-12 education impacts academic performance:
  * Which has been shown to influence:
    1. Level of educational attainment
    2. Personal income
    3. Accumulation of wealth
   
#### The Coleman Report
* **Q:** But are inequalities in school quality the cause of differences in student achievement?
  * The Coleman Report "concluded that the material resources provided in schools made little difference to educational performance" (624).
  * "The decisive influence was the children's backgrounds."
  * "Coleman found that the most important predictor of student learning was a student's family background."
  * Schools play a *secondary* role to that of the varying amounts of knowledge students bring to the classroom as a result of their socioeconomic backgrounds
  * Differences can be detected as young as 2 years old.
  * "Recent research on 'school effects' has generally been supportive of Coleman's conclusion...".
  * "School resources, such as per-pupil spending, contribute less to educational inequality than has been often assumed" (Ritzer & Murphy 2019:289).
  * School funding does not dictate performance.
* **National Center for Educational Statistics**
  * "In 2019, the United States spent $15500 per full-time-equivalent (FTE) student on elementary and secondary education... which was 38 percent higher than the average of OECD member countries of $11300."
  * Despite spending the 5th highest amount among OECD countries:
    * The programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) ranks the United States 38th in Math, 19th in Science, and 13th in Reading
    * Based on funding, the U.S. should rank 5th in scoring
  * "The U.S. schooling system does not create inequality in student learning outcomes" (R&H 2019:299).
  * It can compensate for inequalities, or it can reinforce or increase preexisting inequalities.
  * 'Socioeconomic status' remains the most reliable predictor of student performance and achievement
 #### Social Reproduction Theory
 * According to Jay MacLoed (1987), "the social class into which one is born has a massive influence on where one will end up."
 * Advantage as well as disadvantage is transmitted from generation to generation.
 * Social reproduction theory helps account for the persistence of the 'achievement gap'
 * "Certain groups, such as poor or working-class students, and certain minority groups, tend to receive lower scores on standardized tests and other measures of academic success (e.g., high school graduation rates and college admission rates) than do their more privileged counterparts" (616).
   1. "Middle and upper-middle class parents tend to invest more in their children's cognitive development";
   2. They can afford to "buy the goods and services needed to help their children thrive at school" (616)
   3. They "possess the specific skills and knowledge needed to help their children's performance in school"; and
   4. They "can afford homes in safer neighborhoods with higher-quality schools..." (617).

* "A School in a Garden," by Mitchell Stevens
  * "The pursuit of college credentials is the widest and most dependable path to the good life that American society currently provides..." (570)
* **Q:** What advantages do affluent families offer their children pursuing admission to elite colleges?
  * Affluent families have the resources "to make their children into ideal applicants" (571)
  * "Measurable accomplishment is the baseline criterion selective colleges now use to sort applications" (575).
  * 'Admissibility' involves high GPAs, high test scores, athletic [FILL]
  * "They pay for academically excellent high schools.  They shower their children with books and field trips and lots of adult attention."
  * "They nurture athletic talent through myriad youth sports programs.  They encourage and fund early glimmers of artistic interest.  They channel kids with empathetic hearts toward exotic and traceable forms of humanitarian service" (571).
  * "Keenly aware of the terms of elite admission...
  * Affluent families fashion an entire way of life organized around the production of measurable virtue in children" (571).
  * This results in the assemblage of a 'strong application' which is viewed favorably by admissions committees.
* "The Success Frame and the Asian 'F'," by Jennifer Lee and Min Zhou
  * Since the 1960s, sociologists have emphasized the role of family socioeconomic status "in determining a child's educational and occupational outsomces" (117).
  * However, SES does not explain all group outcomes.
  * For example, "it cannot explain the high educational outcomes for the children of poor and working-class Chinese and Vietnamese immigrants" (118).
  * 'Achievement paradox'
  * Lee and [FILL]
  * "Today, income inequality in the U.S. is greatest among Asians... While Asians overall rank as the highest earning racial and ethnic group in the U.S., it is not a status shared by all Asians." - Pew Research Center (7/12/18)
  * 'Success Frame'
    * There is considerable variation among social groups as to what constitutes 'success'
    * For 1.5- and second-generation Chinese and Vietnamese, success is narrowly defined according to high educational and occupational expectations.
    * The success frame includes:
      * Getting straight As, graduating at the top of one's class, gaining admission to an 'elite college' or 'top university,' earning a graduate degree and "working in one of four high-status professions..."
      * Medicine, law, science, or engineering" (113).
      * Educational achievement factors centrally into this strict success frame:
        * It "reflects the parental belief that it is *only* through getting a good education and earning excellent grades that one is able to secure a [FILL]
    * **Q:** Why is this success frame so consistent among Chinese and Vietnamese interviewees?
      * Important changes in U.S. immigration law led to a "new socioeconomic profile of immigrants" (131).
      * After 1965, Asian immigrants were more highly educated than their predecessors (hyper-selectivity).
  * 2012: Among Asian immigrants age 25 and 64, 61% had at least a bachelor's degree
  * This group serves as resource for working-class coethnics - who come to adopt their aspirations
  * Lastly, parents play a significant role in socializing their children to internalize the 'success frame'.
