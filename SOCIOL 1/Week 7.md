# Week 7
## Conflict Theorist:
* 'Society is composed of groups that compete to determine who gets what and how they get it'
* "When groups operate through established governmental channels to do so, this competition is referred to as politics" (Ritzer 2016:414)

### Sociological Theories of Political Power
There are three sociological theories of political power:
* Pluralist, Class, and Elite
* These theories provide explanations of *how political power is distributed and exercised in modern liberal democracies* (i.e., a type of representative democracy in which elected representatives hold power") (457).
* Weber: "Power is the ability of an individual or group to achieve its goals despite the resistance of others'
* Government: 'Rational-Legal Authority'
* "Domination legitimated on the basis of legally enacted rules and the right of those with authority under those rules to issue commands" (R&M 118).

#### Pluralist Theory
* Seymour Martin Lipset (1922-2006)
* Liberal democracies permits multiple groups and organizations to "compete for access to political power to attempt to further their interests" (Ritzer and Murphy 2019:321).
* Pluralists "see a balance of group power, where no one group retains power indefinitely..." (321).
* "Government policies in a democracy are influenced by the continual process of bargaining... among numberous groups representing different interests..." (463) - thereby dividing up power
* All groups have some effect on policy, but none dominate the mechanisms of government
* The status of any group can always be challenged (e.g., political parties, interest groups, etc.)
* Groups coexist, compete and share in the exercise of power - *power is observed to be widely distributed*
* This 'balance of power' is sustained by civil, political, and social rights associated with citizenship
  * 'Civil rights' include "freedom of speech and religion, the right to own property... equal justice...".
  * 'Political rights' refer to the "right to participate in elections and run for public office" (459).
  * 'Social rights' refer to the "right to every individual to enjoy a minimum standard of economic welfare and security" (460).
    * "A welfare state... exists when government organizations provide materials benefits to citizens."
    * E.g., Minimum wage, unemployment benefits, etc.
    * The right to freedom of expression and assembly enables the formation of 'interest groups'
      * "An interest group is any organization that attempts to persuade elected officials to consider its aims when deciding on legislation" (473)
      * Diverse interest groups compete in U.S. society.
* Pluralists argue that democratic 'political culture' plays a critical role in the distribution of power
* A common set of values [FILL]
  1. Liberalism: Liberty, equality, and property
  2. Individualism: Independence and self-reliance
  3. Populism: Appeals to ordinary people
  4. Meritocracy: Ability determines social standing
  5. Anti-statism: Distrust of government
* The 'nation-state' is composed of...
  * 'Nation': "People with common identity that ideally includes a shared culture, language, and feelings of belonging."
  * 'State': "A political apparatus or government that rules over a territory" (457).
* "Nation-states are associated with the rise of nationalism...
* Which can be defined as a set of symbols and beliefs [FILL]
* A 'pluralist' view of the news media:
  * While not a political power per se, the press - or 'fourth estate' - has considerable influence shaping the public's views of social andpolitical issues
  * News media agencies operate within a 'free market' - they can *compete amongst each other for audiences*.
* The news media impacts public sentiment through the production and circulation of information - *in so doing, it utilizes the 'power of persuasion'*
* While the news media "can relay a certain body of information and a set of attitudes toward that information to people who are open to receiving it... *it cannot reward or punish* the audience for taking the information to heart" (Schudson 2011:56).

#### Economic Theory of Power
* Karl Marx (1818 - 1883)

      * Funding for lobbyists
      * Funding for political campaigns
      * Funding for policy institutes or 'think tanks'
* Interest groups and 'lobbying'
  * "Lobbying is the act of persuading influential officials to vote in favor of a cause or otherwise lend support to the aims of the interest group" (473)
  * All organizations employing lobbyists must register their lobbyists (... [FILL])
* "To run as a political candidate is enormously expensive, and interest groups provide much of the funding at all levels of political office" (473-4).

  * The majority opinion reasoned that corporations - as associations of individuals - are afforded the same rights as regular citizens.
  * "Corporations, which have a strong stake in getting favorable legislation and government contracts... are the largest contributors to campaigns, outspending organized labor as much as 17 to 1" (475).
  * "Paid lobbyists play a significant role in influencing the outcomes of congressional and presidential elections."
  * 2012 Presiential election: "When all was said and done, Barack Obama ($858M) and Mitt Romney ($694M), the two major party candidates for president in 2012, spent close to $1.12 billion...", -OpenSecrets.org
  * "A total of 266 super PACs (Political action committees) have spent $546.5 million - 78% of which has been spent *opposing* candidates." - LA Times (11/20/12)
* **Q:** Since money spent is correlated to influence, if Clinton raised more money in the 2016 election, why did she lose to Trump?
  * Analysts argue that "Trump received far greater media coverage throughout the campaign" (474).
  * "'Free media' exposure was estimated as worth more than $5.9 billion for Trump, more than twice the $2.8 billion in free media estimated for Clinton."

* **Q:** Where is the money being spent?
  * "The candidates, national parties, and super PACs spend the bulk of their campaign cash on *advertising*, mail, staff, and fundraising." - The Washington Post
  * "Super PACs have no limitations on how much they can spend on influencing an election."
* Wealth translates to 'media influence'
  * "A super PAC advocates for the election or defeat of candidates for public office by purchasing television, radio, and print advertisements and other media."

* **Q:** How has the rise of corporations impacted the modern democratic state?
  * "The bourgeoisie has at last... conquered for itself, in the modern representative state, *exclusive political sway*.  The executive of the modern state is buy a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie." - Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels

#### Elite Theory of Power
* *The Power Elite* (1956)
  * "During the 21st century, a process of institutional centralization occurred in the political order, the economy, and the military" (464).
  * [FILL]
  * Mills argued that U.S. "political power had become tightly coordinated at the federal level."
  * The American economy had become dominated "by a cluster of very large corporations."
  * And after "World War II, the military... had grown to a giant establishment..." (464).
  * This concentration of power led to the emergence of 'the power elite'.
  * "They are in command of the major heirarchies and organizations of modern society" (392).
  * "Big three," the 'triangle of power,' or the 'interlocking directorate': Political, economic, and military.
  * "This theory holds that power is *not* dispersed throughout a stable society..."
  * Rather, power si concentrated among a small number of people who control the major [FILL]
  * "These hierarchies of state and corporation and army constitute the means of power" (393).
  * **Q:** Based on this view, where does power reside?
    * Power resides in institutional positions - power has an *institutional* basis: "Power is not of a man" (397).
    * "The higher circles... are often thought of in terms [FILL]
    * By the *decisions* they make: "Their decisions affect the everyday worlds of ordinary men and women" (391).
    * "By the power elite, we refer to those political, economic, and military circles which as an intricate set of overlapping cliques share decisions having at least national consequences.  In so far as national events are decided, *the power elite are those who decide them.*"
    *
