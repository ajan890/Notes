# Week 7
## Conflict Theorist:
* 'Society is composed of groups that compete to determine who gets what and how they get it'
* "When groups operate through established governmental channels to do so, this competition is referred to as politics" (Ritzer 2016:414)

### Sociological Theories of Political Power
There are three sociological theories of political power:
* Pluralist, Class, and Elite
* These theories provide explanations of *how political power is distributed and exercised in modern liberal democracies* (i.e., a type of representative democracy in which elected representatives hold power") (457).
* Weber: "Power is the ability of an individual or group to achieve its goals despite the resistance of others'
* Government: 'Rational-Legal Authority'
* "Domination legitimated on the basis of legally enacted rules and the right of those with authority under those rules to issue commands" (R&M 118).

#### Pluralist Theory
* Seymour Martin Lipset (1922-2006)
* Liberal democracies permits multiple groups and organizations to "compete for access to political power to attempt to further their interests" (Ritzer and Murphy 2019:321).
* Pluralists "see a balance of group power, where no one group retains power indefinitely..." (321).
* "Government policies in a democracy are influenced by the continual process of bargaining... among numberous groups representing different interests..." (463) - thereby dividing up power
* All groups have some effect on policy, but none dominate the mechanisms of government
* The status of any group can always be challenged (e.g., political parties, interest groups, etc.)
* Groups coexist, compete and share in the exercise of power - *power is observed to be widely distributed*
* This 'balance of power' is sustained by civil, political, and social rights associated with citizenship
  * 'Civil rights' include "freedom of speech and religion, the right to own property... equal justice...".
  * 'Political rights' refer to the "right to participate in elections and run for public office" (459).
  * 'Social rights' refer to the "right to every individual to enjoy a minimum standard of economic welfare and security" (460).
    * "A welfare state... exists when government organizations provide materials benefits to citizens."
    * E.g., Minimum wage, unemployment benefits, etc.
    * The right to freedom of expression and assembly enables the formation of 'interest groups'
      * "An interest group is any organization that attempts to persuade elected officials to consider its aims when deciding on legislation" (473)
      * Diverse interest groups compete in U.S. society.
* Pluralists argue that democratic 'political culture' plays a critical role in the distribution of power
* A common set of values [FILL]
  1. Liberalism: Liberty, equality, and property
  2. Individualism: Independence and self-reliance
  3. Populism: Appeals to ordinary people
  4. Meritocracy: Ability determines social standing
  5. Anti-statism: Distrust of government
* The 'nation-state' is composed of...
  * 'Nation': "People with common identity that ideally includes a shared culture, language, and feelings of belonging."
  * 'State': "A political apparatus or government that rules over a territory" (457).
* "Nation-states are associated with the rise of nationalism...
* Which can be defined as a set of symbols and beliefs [FILL]
* A 'pluralist' view of the news media:
  * While not a political power per se, the press - or 'fourth estate' - has considerable influence shaping the public's views of social andpolitical issues
  * News media agencies operate within a 'free market' - they can *compete amongst each other for audiences*.
* The news media impacts public sentiment through the production and circulation of information - *in so doing, it utilizes the 'power of persuasion'*
* While the news media "can relay a certain body of information and a set of attitudes toward that information to people who are open to receiving it... *it cannot reward or punish* the audience for taking the information to heart" (Schudson 2011:56).
