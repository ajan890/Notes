# Week 8
## Gender
### "Sociologists define gender inequality..."
* As the difference in the status, power, and prestige that women and men have in groups, collectivities, and societies" (346).
* Gender inequalities exist across multiple domains, "education, the workplace, the family, and politics."
### 'Sex' and 'gender'
* Sex refers to "physical differences of the body, whereas gender oncerns the psychological, social, and cultural differences" (328).
* "While sex is something we are born with, gender is something that we both learn and do."
### Gender role socialization
* "The process through which we learn about male- and female-typed roles and practices from socializing agents..." (328).
* "We learn what it means to be 'male' or 'female' [FILL]"
* "Sex and gender historically have been viewed as a binary... meaning the categories of male and female, or masculine and feminine, are seen as distinctive and nonoverlapping - even opposing" (328).
* Male and female have been construed as 'opposites'
### Biological essentialism
* "Differences between men and women are natural and inevitable consequences of the intrinsic biological natures of men and women" (329).
* This view typically ignores or minimizes the role of social and cultural influences.
#### While important biological differences do exist...
* They are "amplified by social contexts that promote behaviors that are consistent with gendered stereotypes and expectations" (330).
* "Biological differences are almost always exacerbated or fostered by social contexts and norms" (331).
* The male- and female-bodied are treated differently by agents of socialization
  * We are taught 'gender rules' - males learn the rules of masculinity and females learn the rules of feminity
  * These expectations shape the aesthetic, emotional and behavioral characteristics of men and women
* The binary is neither universal nor accepted by all
  * "Adherence to the gender binary, or the belief that only two genders exist (i.e., male and female) is not universal" (336).
  * Further, "growing numbers of young adults are challenging the male-female dichotomy...".
* Some are "embracing both genders - or switching between the two."
  * "Eschewing labels such as 'male' or 'female'... instead of choosing [FILL]
### Transgender Individuals
* "Trnasgender" describes a person whose gender identity - internal psychological identification - does not align with the person's biological sex
  * Male-identifying as female; female identifying as male
  * For many, it is the result of genetic or biological factors; but for some, this may be by choice.
  * Transgender children - as early as two or three years of age - know their 'real' gender identity
  * There is a 'consistence, persistence and insistence' of being a boy or being a girl
  * Nonconformity, despite social pressure to accept [FILL]
* PBS: "Is gender identity biologically hard-wired?"
  * [FILL]
* Critics of the 'binary' are disapproving of the social constraints it imposes on individuals
* Feminists have long been critical of traditional norms of feminity for 'constraining' the range of roles and identities available to women
* **Q:** On what two 'fronts' is the battle of the sexes being waged?
#### Within the family: Conflict is over responsibilities associated with housework and childrearing
* "Household duties" - housework and child rearing - "are disproportionately borne by women."
* In 2018, women performed an average of 15 hours of housework, compared to men's 4-10 hours
* "On a typical day, 21% of men reported doing any housework, compared with 50% of women" (358).
* "Forty-six percent of men did food preparation or cleanup activities, compared to 69% of women."
* "On those days when they performed any of these activities... women spent an average of 2.6 hours per day while men spent 2 hours." (358).
* Marriage adds housework for wives and reduces housework for husbands
  * "Childless women perform 10 hours of housework a week before marriage and 17 hours after marriage."
  * "Childless men, by contrast, do 8 hours before marriage and 7 hours afterward" (358).
  * "Women also spend more time on child-rearing responsibilities..."
    * Which reflects pervasive assumptions that women are 'naturally' the primary caretaker" (359).
    * Further, researchers have found that "mothers are 44% less likely to be hired than non-mothers" (360).
  * "Ideology of intensive motherhood"
    * "The idea that (1) mothers should be the primary caretakers of their children, (2) child-rearing should include 'copious amounts of time, energy, and material resources,' and (3) giving children these things takes priority over all other interests, desires, [FILL]"
  * "On Gender Differences, No Consensus on Nature vs. Nurture" - *Pew Research Center* (12/7/17)
    * "Seven-in-ten or more \[Americans] say women face a lot of pressure to be an involved parent (77%) and by physically attractive (71%)."
  * Despite this pressure...
    * "Over three-quarters of women (76.4%) with children between the ages of 6 and 17 were in the labor force in 2015" (350).
    * This is three times as many women with children who participated in the labor force in 1950 (US).
#### Outside the family: Conflict is over educational attainment, workplace culture and economic rewards, as well as political representation
* Gender pay gap
  * This refers to the difference in income earnings between an average man and average woman who work full-time, year-round.
  * While the gender pay gap has narrowed in recent years, women make $0.81 for every male dollar.
* [FILL]
* Androcentric pay scale
  * "A strong correlation [exists] between wages and the gender composition of a job" (293).
  * "If there is an androcentric pay scale, then we should expect [FILL]
* "If jobs filled by women are devalued in part because of their association with women...
  * Then we should expect these jobs to pay less than jobs associated with men.  They do." (298).
  * "More than two-thirds (16 of 23) of the lowest-paying occupations are disproportionately female."
