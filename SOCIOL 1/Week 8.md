# Week 8
## Gender
### "Sociologists define gender inequality..."
* As the difference in the status, power, and prestige that women and men have in groups, collectivities, and societies" (346).
* Gender inequalities exist across multiple domains, "education, the workplace, the family, and politics."
### 'Sex' and 'gender'
* Sex refers to "physical differences of the body, whereas gender oncerns the psychological, social, and cultural differences" (328).
* "While sex is something we are born with, gender is something that we both learn and do."
### Gender role socialization
* "The process through which we learn about male- and female-typed roles and practices from socializing agents..." (328).
* "We learn what it means to be 'male' or 'female' in our society."
* "Sex and gender historically have been viewed as a binary... meaning the categories of male and female, or masculine and feminine, are seen as distinctive and nonoverlapping - even opposing" (328).
* Male and female have been construed as 'opposites'
### Biological essentialism
* "Differences between men and women are natural and inevitable consequences of the intrinsic biological natures of men and women" (329).
* This view typically ignores or minimizes the role of social and cultural influences.
#### While important biological differences do exist...
* They are "amplified by social contexts that promote behaviors that are consistent with gendered stereotypes and expectations" (330).
* "Biological differences are almost always exacerbated or fostered by social contexts and norms" (331).
* The male- and female-bodied are treated differently by agents of socialization
  * We are taught 'gender rules' - males learn the rules of masculinity and females learn the rules of feminity
  * These expectations shape the aesthetic, emotional and behavioral characteristics of men and women
* The binary is neither universal nor accepted by all
  * "Adherence to the gender binary, or the belief that only two genders exist (i.e., male and female) is not universal" (336).
  * Further, "growing numbers of young adults are challenging the male-female dichotomy...".
* Some are "embracing both genders - or switching between the two."
  * "Eschewing labels such as 'male' or 'female'... instead of choosing to identify as 'androgyne,' 'genderqueer,' 'genderfluid,' 'agender,' or 'non-cis'" (336).
  * "The term *cis* is Latin for 'on the same side as'."
### Transgender Individuals
* "Trnasgender" describes a person whose gender identity - internal psychological identification - does not align with the person's biological sex
  * Male-identifying as female; female identifying as male
  * For many, it is the result of genetic or biological factors; but for some, this may be by choice.
  * Transgender children - as early as two or three years of age - know their 'real' gender identity
  * There is a 'consistence, persistence and insistence' of being a boy or being a girl
  * Nonconformity, despite social pressure to accept the gender identity associated with one's body
* PBS: "Is gender identity biologically hard-wired?"
  * “ At an early age, 8-year-old Skyler Kelly began to let his parents know that what he looked like on the outside, a girl, is not how he felt on the inside. The science of gender identity isn’t fully understood, but new research points to a complex set of factors, including biological ones” (2015).
* Critics of the 'binary' are disapproving of the social constraints it imposes on individuals
* Feminists have long been critical of traditional norms of feminity for 'constraining' the range of roles and identities available to women
* **Q:** On what two 'fronts' is the battle of the sexes being waged?

### Gender and Pay
#### Within the family: Conflict is over responsibilities associated with housework and childrearing
* "Household duties" - housework and child rearing - "are disproportionately borne by women."
* In 2018, women performed an average of 15 hours of housework, compared to men's 4-10 hours
* "On a typical day, 21% of men reported doing any housework, compared with 50% of women" (358).
* "Forty-six percent of men did food preparation or cleanup activities, compared to 69% of women."
* "On those days when they performed any of these activities... women spent an average of 2.6 hours per day while men spent 2 hours." (358).
* Marriage adds housework for wives and reduces housework for husbands
  * "Childless women perform 10 hours of housework a week before marriage and 17 hours after marriage."
  * "Childless men, by contrast, do 8 hours before marriage and 7 hours afterward" (358).
  * "Women also spend more time on child-rearing responsibilities..."
    * Which reflects pervasive assumptions that women are 'naturally' the primary caretaker" (359).
    * Further, researchers have found that "mothers are 44% less likely to be hired than non-mothers" (360).
  * "Ideology of intensive motherhood"
    * "The idea that (1) mothers should be the primary caretakers of their children, (2) child-rearing should include 'copious amounts of time, energy, and material resources,' and (3) giving children these things takes priority over all other interests, desires, and demands" (Wade and Ferree 2015:255).
  * "On Gender Differences, No Consensus on Nature vs. Nurture" - *Pew Research Center* (12/7/17)
    * "Seven-in-ten or more \[Americans] say women face a lot of pressure to be an involved parent (77%) and by physically attractive (71%)."
  * Despite this pressure...
    * "Over three-quarters of women (76.4%) with children between the ages of 6 and 17 were in the labor force in 2015" (350).
    * This is three times as many women with children who participated in the labor force in 1950 (US).
#### Outside the family: Conflict is over educational attainment, workplace culture and economic rewards, as well as political representation
* Gender pay gap
  * This refers to the difference in income earnings between an average man and average woman who work full-time, year-round.
  * While the gender pay gap has narrowed in recent years, women make $0.81 for every male dollar.
* According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics:
  * "The gender composition of a job is the single largest contributor to the wage gap" (293).
  * Occupational pay and prestige tend to follow sex - "'women's work' pays, on average, anywhere between 5 percent and 21 percent less than 'men's work'"
  * *Washington Center for Equitable Growth* (2018):
    * "Just more than half of gender pay inequality - 50.5 percent — can be explained due to gender differences in the industries (17.6 percent) and occupations (32.9 percent) where men and women work... Wages tend to be lower in occupations that are women-dominated compared to men-dominated occupations of similar skill and education level.”
* Gendered job segregation
  * The concentration of men and women into select occupations due to beliefs about 'appropriate' jobs for men and women (e.g., 'women's work')
  * The American workforce is characterized by a high degree of occupational sex segregation
* Androcentric pay scale
  * "A strong correlation [exists] between wages and the gender composition of a job" (293).
  * "If there is an androcentric pay scale, then we should expect male-dominated jobs to be among the highest paying.  They are." (Wade and Ferree 2015:293).
* "If jobs filled by women are devalued in part because of their association with women...
  * Then we should expect these jobs to pay less than jobs associated with men.  They do." (298).
  * "More than two-thirds (16 of 23) of the lowest-paying occupations are disproportionately female."
#### Why is there GJS?  'Socialization hypothesis'
* "Men an women respond to gender stereotypes when planning, training, and applying for jobs."
* Men and women's beliefs about their own competencies - 'competence bias' - may affect their decisions about what occupations to enter
* 'Employer selection hypothesis'
  * "Employers tend to prefer men for masculine jobs and women for feminine jobs, slotting applicants into gender consistent roles" (Wade and Ferree 2015:290).
  * Employers often rely on gender stereotypes when making decisions related to hiring or job assignment
#### The Accumulative Effect of the Gender Pay Gap:
* Analysts estimate that "over a lifetime the average woman will make $434000 less in income than the average man" (Wade and Ferree 2015:286).
* **Q:** How do sociologists account for economic inequality among men and women?
  * 'Discrimination hypothesis'
    * Women are treated unequally - they are denied equal opportunities and equal compensation
    * **Sexism:** "The belief that one sex is innately superior - intellectually, emotionally and/or physically - to the other" (Chambliss and Eglitis 2016:251).
  * Gender stereotyping:
    * Prejudicial attitudes influence the decisions employers make related to hiring and promotion
    * 'Glass ceiling': "A promotion barrier that prevents a woman's upward mobility within an organization" (Giddens et al. 2020:352).
  * Washington Center for Equitable Growth (2018):
    * "A portion of gender pay inequality - 38% - is unexplained by observable data...".
    * "Most researchers attribute this portion to factors such as discruimination... socially constructed gender norms... and gender stereotyping."
  * 'Devaluation hypothesis'
    * "Women are paid less because the work they perform is socially defined as less valuable than the work men perform" (Mooney et al. 2015:322).
    * "Pay rates are determined in part by cultural understandings regarding the worth of jobs."\
  * Occupations that involve caring, nurturing and empathizing are undervalued in American society
    * "The devaluation of feminized occupations is especially acute for care work" (298).
    * It "involves face-to-face caretaking of the physical, emotional, and educational needs of others" (298).
    * In 2012, the average yearly income of child care workers was only $21,310.
    * "Only twenty-two of the 800 jobs listed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics had lower annual wages; 99.5 percent of jobs in American pay better" (299).
    * People who worked to park cars were paid more
  * 'Human capital hypothesis'
    * Inequalities in pay occur due to differences in the kind and amount of human capital men and women acquire - e.q., levels of education, continuous work experience and job related skills.
    * Work is interruptted by child birth and childrearing
  * 'Motherhood penalty'
    * Women feel pressure to choose 'family-friendly' occupations - jobs that permit flexible hours and career paths
    * PRC: "Seven-in-ten or more \[Americans] say women face a lot of pressure to be an involved parent (77%)."
#### "Falling Back on Plan B," by Kathleen Gerson
* Most young Americans say they prefer an egalitarian family arrangement based on 'equal sharing' of paid labor (employment) and unpaid labor (household)
* 80% of women and 70% of men: Partners should share in breadwinning, housekeeping, and child-rearing
* Yet, while today's young women and men hope to "strike a flexible breadwinning and caretaking balance with an egalitarian partner..."
* Skepticism about achieving this ideal is prompting them to support 'divergent fallback strategies'
* Men and women have clashing 'plan Bs'
* Self-reliant women
  * "Most women prefer self-reliance over economic dependence within a traditional marriage" (161).
  * "When the bonds of marriage are so fragile, relying on a husband for economic security seems foolhardy" (161).
* According to Gerson:
  * "66 percent of women between the ages of eighteen and thirty-four say that 'being successful in a high-paying career' is 'very important' or, even, 'one of the most important things' in their lives."
  * 37 percent say that marriage is a 'top priority'
* "In a reversal of traditional gender roles, young women now surpass young men in the importance they place on having a high-paying career or profession, according to survey findings from the *Pew Research Center*" (4/19/12).
* Neo-traditional men
  * "Most men... prefer a neo-traditional arrangement that allows them to put work first and rely on a partner for the lion's share of caregiving" (161).
  * This modified traditionalism strategy "contrasts vividly with women's search for self-reliance" (162).
#### 'New gender divide'
* "Men's desire to protect work prerogatives collides with women's growing desire for equality and need for independence" (165).
* 70 percent of men chose neo-traditionalism as their plan B, compared to only 25 percent of women.
* "... If equal sharing proves too difficult, men overwhelmingly hope to convince their wives to de-prioritize their careers and focus on homemaking and raising children."
* However, such a 'neo-traditional arrangement' may stimulate feelings of *resentment* - due to stalled careers, financial dependence and restricted autonomy
* Most divorces are initiated by women
  * "Faced with a husband who wants them to be a housewife or work part-time, almost three-quarters of women say they would choose divorce and raise their kids alone." - Lisa Wade
  * Marriage often falls short of egalitarian expectations
