# Week 9
## Class Inequality
* As the differences between populations in terms of their income, wealth, educational attainment, occupational status, and lifestyle
* "The most distinctive form of stratification in modern societies is class divisions" (241).

### [FILL]
* "We can define class as a large-scale grouping of people who share [FILL]
* Class systems - unlike caste systems - are characterized by 'social mobility'
* "They don't fix people for life in specific social positions, as the older systems of stratification did."
* "Class systems are fluid, and movement is possible" - class status is understood to be *achieved*" (242)
* Social mobility "refers to the upward or downward movement of individuals and groups among different class positions...
* "Through changes in occupation, wealth, or income."
* [FILL]
### Mobility
* Two types:
  * "*Intergenerational mobility* refers to social movement across generations... where children are... compared with their parents and grandparents."
  * "*Intragenerational mobility* refers to how far an individual moves up or down the socioeconomic scale... during their working life" (261).
* Social mobility is a ariable phenomenon - there can be more or less of it depending on economic climate
* Periods of economic growth *expand* occupational opportunities, while *constraint* defines periods of decline
* The 2008 recession resulted in downward mobility, but economic expansion (2009-2019) reversed this trend.
### Wealth Distribution
* 'Income' is often considered the most important determinant of one's class position.
* It refers to "wages and salaries earned from paid occupations..." (243).
* The 'real income' of the majority of the American working population has risen over the last century.
* "Many Americans today are more affluent than any peoples have previously been in human history."
* In addition to higher earnings...
  * Technological advancement in industry has increased productivity - leading to an abundance of goods at lower and affordable prices
  * In 1945 to 1975, a large middle class characterized American society. [FILL]
* However, "since the 1970s, income inequality has been increasing dramatically...".
  * "Not everyone has shared equally in the growing productivity of the U.S. economy" (243).
  * A new class structure has emerged reflecting income disparities among households.
* Analysts argue that social mobility - upward and downward - has steadily eroded the middle class
  * "The shrinking of the middle class has been accompanied by an increase in the share of adults in the upper-income tier - from 14% in 1971 to 21% in 2021 - as well as an increase in the share who are in the lower-income tier, from 25% to 29%" - Pew Research Center (4/20/22)
**Q:** Who is the middle-class or middle-income?
* One approach is to divide populations into quintiles - or five groups - based on their earnings.
* "Teardrop model" of the American class structure
  * Today, the richest 1% earn over a quarter of all U.S. pretax income
  * While the lowest 90% earn less than half of all U.S. pretax income (Giddens et al 2020:244).
* "Wealth is usually measured in terms of net worth."
* 'Net worth' refers to the tottal market value of an individual or household's accumulated assets - minus all depts and liabilities.
* E.g., Savings and checkiing accounts, investments in stocks and bonds, real estate, pensions, etc.
* "Research finds that trends in wealth inequality parallel those with income inequality" (245).
* "The average net worth of all American families is only $97300... top 10% has grown to $1.6 million".
* "The rich are getting much, much wealthier relative to everyone else, mainly due to soaring top incomes."
* "It takes money to make money"
* "The wealthy often derive the bulk of their money from their investments..." (245)
* "Much of the wealth of the wealthy lies in financial assets such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other forms of investment...".
* "Some scholars argue that wealth, not income, is the real indicator of social class...".
* "It is less sensitive to fluctuations due to shifting work hours, health, and other factors that might effect one's income in a given year" (245).
* Wealth provides financial stability.
#### Debt
* The opposite of wealth is debt
* Households with lower incomes and less wealth are more likely to rely on credit cards or loands to pay for living expenses.
* Many yound adults have gone increasingly into debt by relying on credit cards and student loans.
