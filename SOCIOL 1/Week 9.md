# Week 9
## Class Inequality
* As the differences between populations in terms of their income, wealth, educational attainment, occupational status, and lifestyle
* "The most distinctive form of stratification in modern societies is class divisions" (241).

### [FILL]
* "We can define class as a large-scale grouping of people who share [FILL]
* Class systems - unlike caste systems - are characterized by 'social mobility'
* "They don't fix people for life in specific social positions, as the older systems of stratification did."
* "Class systems are fluid, and movement is possible" - class status is understood to be *achieved*" (242)
* Social mobility "refers to the upward or downward movement of individuals and groups among different class positions...
* "Through changes in occupation, wealth, or income."
* [FILL]
### Mobility
* Two types:
  * "*Intergenerational mobility* refers to social movement across generations... where children are... compared with their parents and grandparents."
  * "*Intragenerational mobility* refers to how far an individual moves up or down the socioeconomic scale... during their working life" (261).
* Social mobility is a ariable phenomenon - there can be more or less of it depending on economic climate
* Periods of economic growth *expand* occupational opportunities, while *constraint* defines periods of decline
* The 2008 recession resulted in downward mobility, but economic expansion (2009-2019) reversed this trend.
### Wealth Distribution
* 'Income' is often considered the most important determinant of one's class position.
* It refers to "wages and salaries earned from paid occupations..." (243).
* The 'real income' of the majority of the American working population has risen over the last century.
* "Many Americans today are more affluent than any peoples have previously been in human history."
* In addition to higher earnings...
  * Technological advancement in industry has increased productivity - leading to an abundance of goods at lower and affordable prices
  * In 1945 to 1975, a large middle class characterized American society. [FILL]
* However, "since the 1970s, income inequality has been increasing dramatically...".
  * "Not everyone has shared equally in the growing productivity of the U.S. economy" (243).
  * A new class structure has emerged reflecting income disparities among households.
* Analysts argue that social mobility - upward and downward - has steadily eroded the middle class
  * "The shrinking of the middle class has been accompanied by an increase in the share of adults in the upper-income tier - from 14% in 1971 to 21% in 2021 - as well as an increase in the share who are in the lower-income tier, from 25% to 29%" - Pew Research Center (4/20/22)
**Q:** Who is the middle-class or middle-income?
* One approach is to divide populations into quintiles - or five groups - based on their earnings.
* "Teardrop model" of the American class structure
  * Today, the richest 1% earn over a quarter of all U.S. pretax income
  * While the lowest 90% earn less than half of all U.S. pretax income (Giddens et al 2020:244).
* "Wealth is usually measured in terms of net worth."
* 'Net worth' refers to the tottal market value of an individual or household's accumulated assets - minus all depts and liabilities.
* E.g., Savings and checkiing accounts, investments in stocks and bonds, real estate, pensions, etc.
* "Research finds that trends in wealth inequality parallel those with income inequality" (245).
* "The average net worth of all American families is only $97300... top 10% has grown to $1.6 million".
* "The rich are getting much, much wealthier relative to everyone else, mainly due to soaring top incomes."
* "It takes money to make money"
* "The wealthy often derive the bulk of their money from their investments..." (245)
* "Much of the wealth of the wealthy lies in financial assets such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other forms of investment...".
* "Some scholars argue that wealth, not income, is the real indicator of social class...".
* "It is less sensitive to fluctuations due to shifting work hours, health, and other factors that might effect one's income in a given year" (245).
* Wealth provides financial stability.
#### Debt
* The opposite of wealth is debt
* Households with lower incomes and less wealth are more likely to rely on credit cards or loands to pay for living expenses.
* Many young adults have gone increasingly into debt by relying on credit cards and student loans.
* Consumer Financial Protection Bureau:
  * "CFPB Report Finds Credit Card Companies Charged Consumers Record-High $130 Billion in Interest and Fees in 2022" (10/25/23)
    * "Consumers with revolving debts on average pay far more in interest and fees than get back in rewards."
    * "Prices are rising faster than incomes"
    * "In the past year, median household income has grown just 4%, while the overall cost of living has jumped 8%." -Nerdwallet (1/10/23)
    * "Buy now, pay later services may mean deeper debt for millions."
  * *Econimic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2022* (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System)
    * [FILL]
* 'Educational attainment' is another important characteristic of class or socioeconomic standing...
  * Since "education is one of the strongest predictors of occupation, income, and wealth" (247)
  * In 2018, the median income of college grads was $54700, compared to $34900 of high school grads.
* Lastly, 'occupational status' or 'occupational prestige' are also indictors of class standing
  * Public opinion confers occupational prestige
  * "The top-ranked occupations appear to share one of two characteristics: They require a fair amount of either education or public service" (248).
* **Q:** Why are societies economically stratified?
  * Surveys provide insight into the 'public's opinion' on the causes of poverty and affluence
  * Sociological theories of class stratification offer much more theoretically sophisticated explanations based on systematically collected data.
  * "Family Life and Economic Success," by Lisa Keister
    * "Family background can be amont the most critical determinants of success in life" (294)
    * [FILL]
 #### Wealth
 * Direct transfers of wealth from parent to child - 'inter vivos' and 'postmortem' transfers
   * 'Inter vivos' transfers: Money for living expenses, higher education, automobiles, house down payments, etc.; and 'postmortem' transfers: Inheritance

 #### Education
 * "Successful parents also tend to provide relatively high quality education to their children..."
 * Education is a critical component of the wealth accumulation process... \[it] translates into wealth via work experience, financial literacy..." (295).

### Economic Stratification
 * Karl Marx: 'Theory of labor exploitation'
   * "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggle."
   * All ruling classes own the 'means of production,' use this control to exploit laborers and claim the rewards of the productive process
   * Exploitation in capitalism involves 'wage-labor'
     * Workers are paid for their labor - but the market value of what they produce exceeds those wages
     * "Surplus value is the difference between what workers earn for their labor and the value of the goods that they produce" (E&A 2015:73)
 * **'Surplus Value'**
   * "This surplus value is the source of profit, which capitalists put to their own use" (251).
   * "Human labor is thus one commodity that is exchanged for its value \[i.e., wage] while being capable of producing more than its value" (E&A [FILL])
 * While Marx *incorrectly* predicted that "the wages of the working class could never rise far above subsistence level..." (251)
 * That the 'modern laborer' would sink only 'deeper and deeper into pauperism' and poverty
 * He was right about the growing inequality of wealth
 * Thomas Piketty (2013) argues that "unless an [capitalist] economy is growing rapidly... increases in wealth will exceed economic growth."
 * This "will inevitably [FILL]
#### Poverty
 * 'Absolute poverty' means that a person or family does not have access to food, housing, or health care
 * 'Relative poverty' "means being poor as compared with the standards of living of the majority" (266).
 * 'Relative deprivation' refers to the lack of material resources compared with others in society.

---

* According to Max Weber, other factors contribute to economic stratification
  * People's skills and credentials have variable 'market values' - leading to differences in compensation
  * Further, 'pariah groups' can be excluded from select industries and occupations (i.e., discrimination)
  * E.g., "Modern medicine is within the mental capacity of most individuals, but a medical education is so burdensome and expensive that virtually none would undertake it if the position of the M.D. did not carry a reward commensurate with the sacrifice."
  * [FILL]
