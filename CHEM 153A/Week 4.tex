\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[scale=0.5]{L1_16.png}
\end{center}

\section*{Protein Families and Superfamilies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item proteins with significant similarity in primary structure and/or tertiary structure and function are in the same \textbf{protein family}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\sim$4000 different protein families in the PDB
        \item strong evolutionary relationship within a family
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{superfamilies} = 2+ families that have little sequence similarity, but the same major structural motif and have functional similarities.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Globins are a Family of Oxygen-Binding Proteins}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Globins like myoglobin and hemoglobin belong to the same protein family: \textbf{Globin Family}
    \item Globins are a widespread protein family:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item highly conserved tertiary structure: eight $\alpha$-helical segments connected by bends (\textbf{globin fold})
        \item most function in O$_2$ transport or storage
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[scale=0.5]{L1_17.png}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Types of Globins}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Four types in humans and other mammals:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{myoglobin} = monomeric, facilitates O$_2$ diffusion in muscle tissue
        \item \textbf{hemoglobin} = tetrameric, responsible for O$_2$ transport in the bloodstream
        \item \textbf{neuroglobin} = monomeric, expressed largely in neurons to protect the brain from low O$_2$ or restricted blood supply
        \item \textbf{cytoglobin} = monomeric, regulates levels of nitric oxide, a localized signal for muscle relaxation
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Globins and Prosthetic Groups}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Myoglobin} and \textbf{hemoglobin} are examples of \underline{conjugated proteins}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Simple proteins only have a polypeptide chain
        \item \textbf{Conjugated proteins} have a non-protein component called a \underline{prosthetic group}
        \item Myoglobin and hemoglobin have a heme prosthetic group that provides them with oxygen binding functionality (amino acids can't bind oxygen well)
    \end{itemize}
    \item The globins are examples of \textbf{hemoproteins} (proteins with heme prosthetic groups) which are subsets of metalloproteins (proteins with metal prosthetic groups)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This is because heme contains \underline{ferrous iron} (Fe$^{2+}$)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[scale=0.5]{L1_18.png}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Oxygen-carrying proteins}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \underline{Myoglobin (Mb)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item O$_2$ acts as a ligand (can bind max 1 O$_2$)
        \item Only one subunit
        \item Acts as oxygen storage and facilitates diffusion in muscular cells
        \item $\approx$ 64 g of Mb present in an average human body
    \end{itemize}
    \item \underline{Hemoglobin (Hb)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item O$_2$ acts as a ligand (can bind up to 4 O$_2$)
        \item Four subunits, two subunits of $\alpha$-globin, and two subunits of $\beta$-globin
        \item Transports O$_2$ from lungs to peripheral tissues (carried in erythrocytes)
        \item $\approx$ 775 g of Hb present in an average human body
    \end{itemize}
    \item Both rely on the heme prosthetic group
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[scale=0.5]{L1_19.png}
\end{center}

\pagebreak
\subsection*{Oxygen Can Bind to a Heme Prosthetic Group}
Oxygen is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item poorly soluble in aqueous solutions
    \item diffusion through tissues is ineffective over large distances
    \item transition metals have a strong tendency to bind (iron, copper)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Heme} is prosthetic group incorporated during folding
\begin{itemize}
    \item \underline{Protoporphyrin}
\end{itemize}
Heme is responsible for reversible O$_2$ binding.
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[scale=0.4]{L2_1.png}
\end{center}

\subsection*{The Heme Prosthetic Group}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Heme} is prosthetic group incorporated during folding
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \underline{Protoporphyrin}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Responsible for reversible O$_2$ binding
    \item Fe$^{2+}$ has \underline{6 coordination sites/bonds}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 4 are occupied by N of pyrrole rings
        \item 2 sites available perpendicular to protoporphyrin ring
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 1 occupied by proximal His.
        \end{itemize}
        \item The 6th coordination site:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Deoxyhemoglobin}: unoccupied
            \item \textbf{Oxyhemoglobin}: Occupied by O$_2$
            \item \textbf{Carboxyhemoglobin}: Occupied by CO
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[width=\textwidth]{L2_2.png}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Perpendicular Coordination Bonds}
Two perpendicular coordination bonds:
\begin{itemize}
    \item one is occupied by a side-chain nitrogen of a highly conserved \textbf{proximal His} residue
    \item one is the binding site for molecular oxygen (O$_2$)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Fe$^{2+}$ (ferrous iron) binds O$_2$ reversibly
        \item Fe$^{3+}$ (ferric iron) does not bind O$_2$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[scale=0.5]{L2_3.png}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Globin Contributions to O$_2$ Binding}
Why can't we just have heme on its own?
\begin{itemize}
    \item \underline{Proximal histidine} occupies 5th coordination site, holding heme in place (Mb and Hb)
    \item \underline{Other heme stabilizers} - Val and Phe (Mb) or Val and Leu (Hb)
    \item \underline{Distal histidine} stabilizes O$_2$ binding and acts as gate for ligand entry - encouraging specificity (Mb and Hb)
    \item Another contribution is specific to hemoglobin and deals with \underline{cooperativity}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Role of the Distal Histidine}
\begin{itemize}
    \item For \textbf{O$_2$ binding:} The distal histidine stabilizes the oxygen molecule when it binds to the iron ion in the heme group via a \textbf{hydrogen bond}.  This prevent the iron from being oxidized to the Fe$^{3+}$ state, which cannot bind oxygen
    \item For \textbf{CO binding:} The distal histidine \textbf{hinders carbon monoxide binding} by forcing the CO molecule into a less favorable binding orientation:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item CO prefers to bind in a straight geometry to the iron ion, but the distal histidine forces it into a bent geometry, reducing the affinity of hemoglobin for CO.  While CO still binds more strongly than oxygen, the distal histidine helps prevent complete dominance by CO, providing a protective effect.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[width=\textwidth]{L2_4.png}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Carbon Monoxide acts as a competitive inhibitor}
A \textbf{competitive inhibitor} is a compound that binds to the same site as the intended molecule (substrate or ligand), blocking the site
\begin{itemize}
    \item Carbon monoxide acts as a competitive inhibitor to oxygen with respect to Hb
\end{itemize}

\section*{Myoglobin Has a Single Binding Site for Oxygen}
\begin{itemize}
    \item myoglobin:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 153 residues + one moleule of heme
        \item bends named after the $\alpha$-helical segments they connect
    \end{itemize}
    \item His$^{93}$ = ninety-third residue from the amino terminal end
    \item His F8 = eighth residue in $\alpha$ helix F    
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[width=\textwidth]{L2_5.png}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Protein-Ligand Interactions Can Be Describbed Quantitively}
A simple \textbf{equilibrium expression} describes the reversible binding of a protein (P) to a ligand (L):
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[width=\textwidth]{L2_6.png}
\end{center}

\section*{Association Constant}
The \textbf{association constant} ($K_a$) provides a measure of the affinity of the ligand L for the protein
\begin{itemize}
    \item higher $K_a$ = higher affinity
    \item equivalent to the ratio of the rates of the forward (association) and the reverse (dissociation) reactions that form the PL complex
    \item $K_a$ and $K_d$ are the forward and reverse rate constants
    \[k_a [P] \cdot [L] = k_d[PL]\]
    \[K_a = \frac{[PL]}{[P][L]} = \frac{k_a}{k_d}\]
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Dissociation Constant}
The \textbf{dissociation constant} ($K_d$) is the reciprocal of $K_a$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item equilibrium constant for the release of ligand
    \item lower $K_d$ = higher affinity.
\end{itemize}
\[K_d = \frac{[P][L]}{[PL]} = \frac{k_d}{k_a}\]
\begin{itemize}
    \item $K_d$ is often used to describe protein-ligand \underline{interactions in practice}
    \item A \textbf{low $K_d$} means strong binding (high affinity) because the protein-ligand complex is less likely to dissociate
    \item A \textbf{high $K_d$} means weak binding (low affinity)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Understanding Protein-Ligand Binding via Equilibrium Constants}
\begin{itemize}
    \item At \textbf{equilibrium}, the ratio of bound ligand (PL) to free ligand (P and L) is constant, and this ratio is determined by $K_a$ or $K_d$.
    \item $K_a$ gives us an idea of how readily the protein binds the ligand, while $K_d$ tells us how easily the complex falls apart.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Representative $K_d$ Values}
Avidin-biotin complex is the strongest known non-covalent interaction ($K_d = 10^{-15}$M) between a protein and ligand
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[width=\textwidth]{L2_7.png}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Binding Equilibrium}
Let's consider binding equilibrium from the standpoint of the fraction of binding sites on the protein that are occupied by ligand.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fractional Occupancy} (Y or $\theta$): is the fraction of the total protein bound to the ligand at any given ligand concentration (fraction of binding sites occupied)
    \[Y = \frac{\text{binding sites occupied}}{\text{total binding sites}} = \frac{[PL]}{[PL] + [P]}\]
    \item $Y$ ranges from 0 to 1.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $Y = 1$ means all binding sites are occupied (fully saturated with ligand)
        \item $Y = 0$ means no binding sites are occupied (all protein is in its unbound state)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{align*}
    K_a &= \frac{[PL]}{[P][L]}\\
    K_a[L][P] &= [PL]
    \intertext{substititing $K_a[L][P]$ for $[PL]$\dots}
    Y &= \frac{K_a [L][P]}{K_a[L][P] + [P]}\\
    &= \frac{K_a[L]}{K_a[L] + 1}\\
    &= \frac{[L]}{[L] + \frac{1}{K_a}}\\
    &= \frac{[L]}{[L] + K_d}
\end{align*}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This expression describes a hyperbola!
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Graphical Representations of Ligand Binding}
\[Y = \frac{[L]}{[L] + \frac{1}{K_a}} = \frac{[L]}{[L] + K_d}\]
\begin{itemize}
    \item [L] at which half of the available ligand-binding sites are occupied ($Y = 0.5$) corresponds to $K_d$ or $1 / K_a$.
    \item Therefore, our best method for finding $K_d$ is to find [L] when $Y = 0.5$.
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[scale=0.5]{L2_8.png}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Binding of O$_2$ to Myoglobin}
\begin{itemize}
    \item substituting the [O$_2$] for [$L$]
    \[Y = \frac{[O_2]}{[O_2] + K_d}\]
    \item $K_d$ equals the [O$_2$] at which half of the available ligand-binding sites are occupied, or [O$_2$]$_{0.5}$.
    \[Y = \frac{[O_2]}{[O_2] + [O_2]_{0.5}}\]
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Partial Pressure of O$_2$}
\begin{itemize}
    \item partial pressure of O$_2$ (pO$_2$) is easier to measure than [O$_2$].
    \item Defining the partial pressure of oxygen at [O$_2$]$_{0.5}$ as $P_{50}$:
    \[Y = \frac{[O_2]}{[O_2] + P_{50}}\]
    \item Thus, $P_{50}$ refers to the \textbf{partial pressure of oxygen (pO$_2$)} at which the \textbf{fractional saturation (Y)} of a protein (like hemoglobin or myoblobin) is $50\%$.  In other wordsd, $P_{50}$ \textbf{is the partial pressure of oxygen at which half of the binding sites on the protein are occupied by O$_2$ molecules.}
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[scale=0.6]{L2_9.png}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In physiology, pO$_2$ is directly related to how gases exchange in the lungs and tissues.  Hemoglobin saturation and oxygen transport are functions of pO$_2$ rather than the direct concentration of oxygen.  Therefore, pO$_2$ is more relevant and practical to measure in the context of oxygen binding and release in biological systems, especially for processes like respiration and oxygen transport.
    \item P$_{50}$ \textbf{is a measure of the affinity of the protein for oxygen.}  A \textbf{lower P$_{50}$} means that the protein has a \textbf{higher affinity} for oxygen (it can bind oxygen more easily at a lower pO$_2$), while a \textbf{higher P$_{50}$} indicates a \textbf{lower affinity} (it requires a higher pO$_2$ to achieve 50\% saturation)
\end{itemize}

\pagebreak
\subsection*{Binding of O$_2$ to Myoglobin and Hemoglobin}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mylglobin} has a \textbf{very low P$_{50}$} indicating a \textbf{high affinity for oxygen.}  It binds oxygen tightly, even at low partial pressures, which is important for oxygen storage in muscle tissues
    \item \textbf{Hemoglobin}, on the other hand, \textbf{has a higher P$_{50}$ than myoglobin}, reflecting its lower affinity for oxygen compared to myoglobin.  This \textbf{allows hemoglobin to release oxygen more easily in tissues where the partial pressure of oxygen is lower}, while still binding oxygen efficiently in the lungs, where the partial pressure is higher
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Behavior of Myoglobin with respect to partial pressure of oxygen in the body}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[scale=0.8]{L2_10.png}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
    \item At low pO$_2$, myoglobin has a high affinity for oxygen, enabling it to effectively bind oxygen in tissues even when oxygen levels are low.
    \item Myoglobin is primarily found in muscle tissues and serves as an \textbf{oxygen storage molecule}.  
    \item In resting muscle, O$_2$ is moderate ($\sim$4-5 kPa), and myoglobin maintains a high saturation level, acting as a reservoir.  In active muscle, pO$_2$ rops to very low levels (<1 kPa), prompting myoglobin to release its stored oxygen to support metabolic activity
    \item \textbf{Venous blood} (blue): low partial pressure of oxygen (pO$_2$), which is oxygen-poor and returning to the lungs.
    \item \textbf{Arterial blood} (red): high partial pressure of oxygen (pO$_2$), which is oxygem-rich and delivering oxygen to tissues.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Oxygen Binding to Myoglobin}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[width=\textwidth]{L2_11.png}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
    \item At 13.3 kPa (lungs/alveoli) reflects oxygen-rich conditions in the lungs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Myoglobin is almost fully saturated with oxygen at this high partial pressure
        \item Binds oxygen very efficiently, acting as an oxygen reservoir
        \item The binding curve is hyperbolic, approaching 100\% saturation at these oxygen levels
    \end{itemize}
    \item At 5.3 kPa (capillary blood/tissues) Oxygen pressure is lower, myoglobin remains highly saturated acting as an oxygen reservoir, essential for maintaining oxygen supply in tissues
    \item At <1 kPa (mitochondria):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item At very low pO$_2$ levels inside mitochondria, myoglobin begins releasing oxygen (crucial for cellular respiration)
        \item Myoglobin's high affinity ensures oxygen is available exactly where it's needed for energy production, such as in muscle cells during activity
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Why doesn't myoglobin carry O$_2$ through the body?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Myoglobin tightly binds to O$_2$ at low pO$_2$ \textbf{and} high pO$_2$
    \item An efficient carrier of O$_2$ has to \textbf{let go of it} when exposed to loewr pO$_2$
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[width=\textwidth]{L2_12.png}
\end{center}

\subsection*{We need a different kind of curve}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Myoglobin can't let go in O$_2$ in tissues so why don't we lower its affinity?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Low affinity too inefficient
    \end{itemize}
    \item We need an oxygen-binding protein that can flip its behavior \textbf{sigmoidally} when moving from low affinity to high affinity
    \item Has to have:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Multiple binding sites
        \item Binding sites must be able to "communicate to each other"
        \begin{itemize}
            \item We're going to call the \textbf{cooperativity}
        \end{itemize}

\subsection*{Graphical Representations of Ligand Binding}
\textbf{Fractional Occupancy (Y or $\theta$)}
\[Y = \frac{\text{binding sites occupied}}{\text{total binding sites}} = \frac{[\text{PL}]}{[\text{PL}] + [\text{P}]} = \frac{[\text{L}]}{[\text{L}] + \frac{1}{K_a}}\]
\begin{itemize}
    \item [L] at which half of the available ligand-binding sites are occupied ($Y = 0.5$) corresponds to $K_d$.
    \item A lower value of $K_d$ corresponds to a higher affinity of ligand for the protein
    \item The more tightly a protein binds a ligand, the lower the concentration of ligand required for half the binding sites to be occupied, and thus the lower value of $K_d$
    \item \[Y = \frac{[O_2]}{[O_2] + K_d} = \frac{[O_2]}{[O_2] + [O_2]_0.5}\]
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Hemoglobin Subunits are Structurally Similar to Myoglobin}
Hemoglobin:
\begin{itemize}
    \item tetrameric protein with 4 heme groups
    \item adult hemoglobin has two globin types: two $\alpha$ chains (141 residues each) and two $\beta$ chains (146 residues each)
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[scale=0.7]{L3_2.png}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Key steps in the evolution of the tetrameric hemoglobin protein}

\subsection*{Structural Conversation of Globins}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[width=\textwidth]{L3_4.png}
\end{center}

\subsection*{The Quaternary Structure of Hemoglobin}
\begin{itemize}
    \item strong interactions between unlike subunits ($\alpha$ and $\beta$)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item hydrophobic effect
        \item hydrogen bonds
        \item ion pairs (salt bridges)
    \end{itemize}
    \item $\alpha_1 \beta_1$ (and $\alpha_2 \beta_2$) interface involves >30 residues
    \item $\alpha_1 \beta_2$ (and $\alpha_2 \beta_1$) interface involves 19 residues
\end{itemize}
The binding of a protein and ligand is often coupled to a conformational change in the protein that makes the binding site more complementary to the ligand, permitting tighter binding.  The structureal adaptation that occurs between protein and ligand is called \textbf{induced fit}.

\subsection*{Hemoglobin Undergoes a Structural Change on Binding Oxygen}
There are two conformations of hemoglobin:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{T state} = more stable when O$_2$ is absent, predominant conformation of \textbf{deoxyhemoglobin}
    \item \textbf{R state} = O$_2$ has a higher affinity for hemoglobin
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[scale=0.5]{L3_5.png}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Change in State from T $\rightarrow$ R}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[width=\textwidth]{L3_6.png}
\end{center}

\subsection*{How does oxygenation promote the R state?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In \textbf{T} state, \textbf{Fe$^{2+}$} sits below the plane of protoporphyrin
    \item When oxygen binds, this pulls the \textbf{Fe$^{2+}$} downwards, pulling the \underline{proximal His} along
    \item This shifts the alpha helix (Helix F) that the proximal His is a part of.
    \item \underline{Helix F} movement alters the spatial arrangement of subunits
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[width=\textwidth]{L3_8.png}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Disruption of Salt Bridges Reinforces Transition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Shifting causes salt bridges between adjacent subunits to break
    \item The more bridges break, the more \textbf{Relaxed} structure you get (this is where R state name comes from - T state is Tense)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{(From Before\dots) We need a different kind of curve}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Myoglobin can't let go in O$_2$ in tissues so why don't we lower its affinity?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Low affinity too inefficient
    \end{itemize}
    \item We need an oxygen-binding protein that can flip its behavior \textbf{sigmoidally} when moving from low affinity to high affinity
    \item Has to have:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Multiple binding sites
        \item Binding sites must be able to "communicate to each other"
        \begin{itemize}
            \item We're going to call the \textbf{cooperativity}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[scale=0.6]{L3_12.png}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Cooperativity in Hemoglobin}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cooperativity} happens when the shape of one subunit (in a multi-subunit protein) is \underline{altered by the ligand}, impacting the shape of a neighboring subunit
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Positive cooperativity} when this effect increases affinity for the ligand at the other subunits
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Sigmoidal binding curve is how we recognize the image below.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Negative cooperativity} when this effect decreases affinity for the ligand at the other subunits
    \end{itemize}
    \item Hemoglobin is \underline{positively cooperative} its four subunits increase in affinity as oxygen binds
    \begin{itemize}
        \item T $\rightarrow$ R state is low $\rightarrow$ high affinity
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{R and T states of Hemoglobin}
\begin{itemize}
    \item As pO$_2$ increases, oxygen binds to hemoglobin
    \item This increases the likelihood of transitioning to R state
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Which increases the affinity to O$_2$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Same process can occur in reverse ($\downarrow$ pO$_2$, $\downarrow$ O$_2$ binding, R $\rightarrow$ T, $\downarrow$ affinity)
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}

    \includegraphics*[scale=0.7]{L3_14.png}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Measuring Cooperativity - Hill Coefficient}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cooperativity can be quantified - generating our sigmoidal behavior
    \item \textbf{The Hill Coefficient (nH) determines the degree of cooperativity of a protein-ligand system}
    \item Cannot exceed the number of ligand binding sites on the protein
    \item \textbf{Hill coefficient} = $n_H$ = slope of a Hill plot
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $n_H = 1$, ligand binding is not cooperative
        \item $n_H > 1$ indicates positive cooperativity
        \item $n_H < 1$ indicates negative cooperativity
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\[Y = \frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]} \hspace{1.5cm} Y = \frac{[L]^n}{K_d + [L]^n}\]
\begin{itemize}
    \item Based on the equation, the Hill plot should have a slope of $n$.  However, the experimentally determined slope actually reflects not the number of binding sites but the degree of interaction between them.  The slope of a Hill plot is therefore denoted by nH, the \textbf{Hill coefficient}, which is a measure of the degree of cooperativity.

\subsection*{Allosteric Regulation of Protein Function}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Allosteric regulation} is the regulation of protein function by the binding of an effector molecule at a site other than the impacted site (also a concept for enzymes)
    \item Allosteric regulation can be homotropic or heterotropic
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Homotropic regulation} is when the substrate also regulates function
        \item \textbf{Heterotropic regulation} is when a different molecule than the substrate regulates function
        \item Can be positive or negative
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Positive} regulation increases activity/finding, \textbf{negative} decreases activity/binding
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[width=\textwidth]{L3_16.png}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Other Allosteric Regulators of Hemoglobin: 2, 3-BPG}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Oxygen isn't the only regulator of hemoglobin's behavior
    \item \textbf{2,3-BPG} (2,3-Bisphosphoglyceric acid) is a heterotropic negative regulator of O$_2$ binding that's present in human red blood cells at high concentrations ($\approx$5 mmol/L)
    \item It binds to the central cavity of hemoglobin, stabilizing the T state
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics*[width=0.5\textwidth]{L3_17.png}
    \end{center}
    \item Behavior of BPG was discovered when researchers studied \textbf{pure hemoglobin}
    \item Pure hemoglobin couldn't release O$_2$ at low pO$_2$, which would create a low efficiency delivery system
    \begin{itemize}
        \item BPG attunes hemoglobin's binding curve for maximal delivery
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
