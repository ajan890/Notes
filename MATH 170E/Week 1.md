<strong>Homework Grading:</strong>  The final grade used for the Homework category is determined by the formula: <br>

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?{\color{Red}\text{Final&space;HW}&space;=&space;\text{min}(\text{HW},&space;1.5&space;\times&space;\text{Final&space;Exam})&space;}" title="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?{\color{Red}\text{Final HW} = \text{min}(\text{HW}, 1.5 \times \text{Final Exam}) }" />

<strong>Ex. </strong> If the average homework grade is 92%, but the final exam grade is 60%, then the final homework grade used for the grade calculation will be 90%. <br>

<strong>Oral Exam </strong> If you do not attend class frequently, you would be required to take an oral exam (5-10 minutes) before the final.

## Probability

Consider the example questions: What is the probability that your first child is male? Or, what is the probability that it rains tomorrow? <br>

These are examples of <strong> applied probability</strong>, or cases of probability that apply to something in the real world.  For example, the first question may consider probabilities of genetic defects, and the second question may consider weather patterns from previous years.  This class does <strong> not </strong> cover applied probability.  Instead, it covers probability theory, or <em>pure probability</em>.  An example of this would be: If the chance of raining tomorrow is 20%, what is the chance of it not raining tomorrow? <br>
