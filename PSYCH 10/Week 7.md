* We tend to remember the first few words and the last few words better than the ones in the middle.
* Serial position effects can be evidence for separate short versus long term memory systems.
  * Primary = Long term memory
  * Recency = Short term memory<br>

* When we add a delay between the study and the test, the recency effect disappears and only the primary effect is there.

### Some tasks involve more than one memory store
* For example, doing mental arithmetic.
  * Sensory Store (maybe)
  * Short-term and working memory
    * Holds information about the particular problem
    * Applies the rules and strategies retrieved from long-term memory to the present information
    * Transiently stores intermediate outcomes and final solution
  * Long-term memory
    * Rules of arithmetic
    * Learned strategies for solving problems

## Types of Long Term Memory
* <strong>Explicit Memory</strong>
  * knowing "what"
  * expressed verbally
  * conscious awareness
  * a.k.a. "Declarative Memory"
* <strong>Implicit Memory</strong>
  * knowing "how"
  * expressed behaviorally
  * awareness not necessary
  * a.k.a. "Non-declaratve Memory"

### Explicit Memory
* <strong>Episodic Memory</strong>
  * specific time, place
  * personally experienced
  * <em>Prospective memory:</em> future events
* <strong>Semantic Memory</strong>
  * facts
  * general knowledge

### Implicit Memory
* <strong>Procedural Memory</strong>
  * skills
  * "how to" do something
  * For example, riding a bike
* <strong>Priming</strong>
  * Ex. Memorize the following words:
    > Octopus, Analogy, Climate
  * Fill in the blank
    > C\_m\_\_a<br>
    > \_l\_m\_te<br>
    > Ha\_\_er<br>
    > O\_t\_p\_\_<br>
  * You were probably faster for the words you were primed with.
* <strong>Conditioning</strong>

### Amnesia
* <strong>Retrograde Amnesia</strong>
  * Patients cannot remember events prior to brain damage
* <strong>Anterograde Amnesia</strong>
  * Patients cannot form new memories or remember events after brain damage<br>

* <strong>Case Study: Patient HM</strong>
  * Anterograde amnesia
  * Unable to form new explicit memories (but <em>can</em> form new implicit memories)
  * HM had difficulty transferring explicit memories from STM -> LTM due to removal of hippocampus
  * He performed a mirror tracing task three times, and improved with each time.  However, each time he claimed that he has never done the task before.
    * He does not remember the explicit memory of going to the lab and doing the task, but he does keep the skill he gained.<br>

    * He made less errors each time despite not remembering ever doing the task

* <strong>Case Study: Patient KC</strong>
  * Severe <em>retrograde and anterograde amnesia</em>
  * Old semantic memories intact but not episodic.
    * He could name the make and model of his car, and even the steps on how to change a tire.
    * However, he could not remember whether or not he had a crash with the car or whether or not he has changed a tire before.

### Retrieval
* Retrieval is NOT like playback of a video
  * Remember the testing effect?
* Reteieval depends on <strong>cues</strong>/hints that help bring information to mind
  * Evidence: <strong>Context effects</strong>
    * Context helps with retrieval
    * Context may be many different things
      * Other words on list
      * Internal state at the time of encoding
      * Environmental cues such as odors or sounds
    * <strong>Encoding specificity principle: </strong> memory is improved when information available at encoding is also available at retrieval
      * The more similar the retrieval situation is to the encoding situation, the better the retrieval<br>

    * The effects of studying and context
      * Test taking and similar context of rooms
      * Use of imagery and mental time travel...
    * Are there benefits of different context?
      * Always study at the same place?
      * Different context leads to more retrieval cues

### How to measure what you know?
* Recall
  * Name everything you need to buy at the market
* Recognition
  * You see a tomato and decide whether it was on your list
* Savings
  * Can you learn something faster the second time around?

### Memory Failures
#### Interference
* <strong>Proactive</strong>
  * Old learning gets in the way of new
    * Ex. Remembering your new phone number
* <strong>Retroactive</strong>
  * New learning gets in the way of old
    * Ex. Remembering your old phone number

#### Blocking
* Failing to recall something, even when you know it!
  * "Tip of the tongue" effect
