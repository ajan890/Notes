## Biological Psychology
### The Mind/Body Problem
How is your mind related to your brain/body?
<strong>Descartes</strong> believed the mind and body are separate.<br>
What if someone...<br>
* Had a heart transplant?<br>
* Switched their brain?<br>
  * Would you still be the same person?<br>
* Had a brain injury?<br>
  * Are they still themselves?<br>
* Mind <em>is</em> what the brain <em>does</em>?<br>

### 3 Major Regions of the Brain

<strong>Hindbrain:</strong><br>
* <strong>Cerebellum:</strong> motor coordination/control<br>
* <strong>Medulla:</strong> coordinates heart rate, circulation, respiration<br>
* <strong>Reticular formation:</strong> regulates sleep, wakefulness, and arousal<br>
* <strong>Pons:</strong> relays information from cerebellum to the rest of the brain <br>

<strong>Midbrain:</strong><br>
* <strong>Tegmentum:</strong> <br>
* <strong>Tectum:</strong> both orient in response to stimuli; controls reflexes <br>
* Technically you don't need a midbrain in order to live. <br>

<strong>Forebrain:</strong><br>
* <strong>Subcortical Structures:</strong> <br>
  * <strong>Thalamus:</strong> Filters and transmits info from senses to the cortex.  Controls all senses other than smell. <br>
  * <strong>Hypothalamus:</strong> Regulates the 4 F's: Fighting, Fleeing, Feeding, Mating (F\*cking) <br>
  * <strong>Amygdala:</strong> Role in emotional processes <br>
  * <strong>Hippocampus:</strong> Critical for creating and integrating new memories <br>
    * Patient H.M. had his hippocampus removed in order to reduce the severity of his seizures.  He had extreme difficulty forming new memories after than, although he could remember aspects of his childhood.<br>
  * <strong>Basal Ganglia:</strong> Controls intentional movement <br>
* <strong>Cortexes: </strong> <br>
  * <strong>Occipital Lobe:</strong> processes visual information <br>
  * <strong>Temporal Lobe:</strong> processes auditory information <br>
  * <strong>Parietal Lobe:</strong> processes touch, temperature, and taste <br>
  * <strong>Frontal Lobe:</strong> processes voluntary movement and manages high level language and other functions
  * <strong>Somatosensory Cortex:</strong> Processes touch. <br>
    * Cortical representations of information are weighted by "importance".  For example, the part of the somatosensory cortex that processes data from hands is disproportionally large for the size of the hand, because a lot of touch information comes from hands.<br>
  * <strong>Prefrontal Cortex:</strong> Allows for planning, impulse control<br>
    * Develops very slowly, not fully developed until 20-25 years of age.<br>
  * <strong>Motor Cortex:</strong> Allows for movements <br>
    * Cortical representations of information are weighted by "importance".  Areas of the body that can make quick, precise movements, such as the hands or tongue, take up more cortical real estate.<br>
    * The left side of the body is controlled by the right motor cortex, and the right side of the body is controlled by the left motor cortex.<br>

### Language in the Brain
<strong>Broca's area:</strong> language production<br>
<strong>Wernicke's area:</strong> speech comprehension<br>
<strong>Aphasia:</strong> the loss of ability to use or understand speech/language.  This can be caused by damage to Broca's Area or Wernicke's Area.<br>
