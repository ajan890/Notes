* Developed by Piaget
### Sensorimotor Stage
* Infants progresss from simple reflex actions to symbolic processing
* Develop an understanding of **object permanence**.
  * Object permanence is the understnading that objects continue to exist when they are no longer visible.
  * Around 9 months of age infants will search for hidden objects
* Violation of Expectations
  * Originated because people questioned whether Piaget's object permanence test gave valid results - infants may know the object is there, just do not bother reaching for it.
  * Infants will look longer at events that violate their expectations (surprising or impossible)
  * Able to test object permanence in infants even younger (3 months instead of 9 months)
  * The experiment:
    * Baillargeon, 1986, 1991
    * An infant is familiarized with a toy car, a ramp, and a Mickey Mouse figurine.
    * They are then given an expected and unexpected event.  
      * The expected event, they put the Mickey Mouse figure behind the track (so the car passes in front), block the area of vision of the infant, and roll the car down the ramp.  The car passes behind the covering but in front of the figurine, and comes out the other side.
      * The unexpected event, they put the Mickey Mouse figure on the track, cover it up, and roll the car down the ramp.  The car this time seems to pass through the figurine, by one of the experimenters moving it.
      * The infant looks at the unexpected event for a longer time, showing they do have object permanence, because if they didn't, they would not question the unexpected event.

### Preoperational Stage
* Can mentally represent objects and think symbollically
* **Limitations**
  * Difficulty with logical reasoning/problem solving
  * Difficulty representing the psychological experiences of others
  * **Conservation** - understanding that altering an object's physical appearance does not change its quantitative properties (liquid, number, mass, volume, etc.)

    * Children do NOT pass conservation tasks until 6 to 7 years of age
    * Why do preoperational children have difficulty?
      * Centration (focus only on one specific physical aspect, such as height)
      * Lack reversibility (can't reverse the steps)
    * Do you think the demands of this task might mask children's true abilities?
      * Verbal demanding
      * Transformation is superficial
  * **Three Mountains Task**

    * Three paper-mache mountains are placed on a table.  The child is allowed to familiarize themselves with the mountains from different angles.
    * They are then asked what would the teddy bear see from its perspective.
    * Most children would describe their own perspective - they are *egocentric*.
    * Children do NOT pass the three mountains task until 7 to 8 years of age.
    * Do you think the demands of this task might mask children's true abilities?
      * Spatial abilities
      * Memory
      * Verbally demanding
      
### Concrete Operational Stage
* Pass conservation tasks and can think logically about concrete situations
* **Limitations**
  * Reasoning is limited to real, present objects
  * Difficulty with tasks that require mental manipulation.
    * For example, if you give them hypothetical problems, they are unable to solve them
    * Also problems that require memory.  For example, "A is taller than B, B is taller than C, who is tallest?"

### Formal Operational Stage
* Become capable of flexible and abstract thought
* Essentially, the child is capable of logical thinking like an adult, although they might not be as capable on more memory intensive or complex problems

### Piaget's Contributions
* Founded the discipline of cognitive development
* **Explained**, not *just described*, development
* **Criticisms of Piaget**
  * May have underestimated children's abilities
  * Vague with respect to the processes and mechanisms of change
  * Stage model doesn't account for ariability in children's performance
  * Undervalues the influence of sociocultural environment

## Social Psychology
* **Social psychology:** concerned with the way individuals' *thoughts*, *feelings*, and *behaviours* are influenced by *others*
* Social cognition
  * How do we understand & evaluate others?
* Group Behavior
  * How do we behave around others?

### Social Cognition
#### Evaluating Others
  * How skilled are we in evaluating others?
  * How do we make these first impressions and what are the implications?
  * Experiment: Evaluations of Professors
    * Ambady and Rosenthal, 1993
    * University students were given 10-second clips of a professor teaching without volume.  They are then tasked to rate the professor on 15 different dimensions.
    * They found that the grades given from the 10-second clips do in fact correlate with student ratings of the professor in the course evaluations.
  * Participants were surprisingly *accurate* in their evaluations of teachers based on *thin-slices* of behaviour
    * Accurary = ability to predict end of year evaluations
  * This can be done with many other factors
    * Rule and Ambady, 2008, 2010, 2011
    * Ambady, Hallahan, Conner, 1999
    * Sexual Orientation
      * Apparently members of the LGBTQ+ community are better at this
    * Political Orientation
    * Future success of lawyers based on college year book photos
#### Stereotypes
* Stereotypes can be:
  * Inaccurate
  * Overused
    * Ex. Men generally can do more pull ups than women, only ON AVERAGE
    * Crossing category boundaries makes things seem more different, and we underestimate variability within categories
  * Can lead to bias
  * Can lead to **Stereotype threat:** fear of confirming a negative stereotype about their social group
