# Week 5
## Visual Processing Streams
* After the visual cortex, information is routed to other cortical areas for processing
  * Dorsal - "Where pathway"
  * Ventral - "What pathway"

### Ventral Pathway
* Important for face processing & object recognition
  * <strong>Visual agnosia:</strong> inability to recognize objects
  * <strong>Prosopagnosia:</strong> inability to recognize familiar faces

### Visual Perception
* <strong>How do we get from 2D to 3D?</strong><br>

  * <strong>Monocular Depth Cues:</strong>
    * Help us perceive depth using one eye<br>

  * <strong>Binocular Depth Cues:</strong>
    * <strong>Retinal disparity:</strong> different retinal imates each eye receives based on its different perspective
    * <em>Convergence:</em> when a person views a nearby object, the eye muscles turn the eyes inward<br>

* <strong>How do we keep our perception of an object constant despite different input?</strong>
  * <strong>Size Constancy</strong><br>

## Auditory Systems
### Audition

* Sound enters through the auditory canal, and vibrates the eardrum.  The eardrum amplifies the sound through the cochlea, which vibrates hair cells which send the signal to the brain.

<strong>Sound Localization:</strong><br>
* You can tell where a sound is coming from by comparing the volume the sound you hear in both ears, and also which ear the sound reaches first.

<strong>Multimodal Integration</strong><br>
* <strong>Multipodal perception:</strong> Effect that concurrent stimulation in more than one modality has on perception of events and objects in the world.
  * For exmaple, the <strong>McGurk Effect</strong>
    * What you see may influence what you hear.
  * <strong>Synaesthesia</strong>
    * Condition in which percepual or cognitive activities (i.e., listing to music, reading) triggers exceptional sensory experiences.<br>

## Learning
* What do you think of?
  * Effortful?
  * Academic: Facts/Concepts?
  * Skills: Learn to ride a bike?
  * How to behave: "I learned my lesson?"
* Learning is: "Experience that results in a relatively permanent change in the state of the learner.

### Classical Conditioning
* "Discovered" by Ivan Pavlov in 1996
  * He originally was interested in studying dog saliva.  He would feed the dog meat powder to collect their saliva for experiments.  However, he found out that they would begin to salivate whenever he walked into the room, whether or not he was carrying food.
  * Salivation was (eventually) triggered by what should have been <strong>neutral stimuli</strong> such as:
    * just seeing the food.
    * seeing the dish.
    * seeing the person who brought the food.
    * just hearing that person's footsteps.<br>
<strong>Acquisition</strong><br>
* Before conditioning: yummy dog food is a unconditioned stimulus (US).  The dog salivates which is a unconditioned response (UR).
* During conditioning (acquisition): suppose a bell is rung every time the dog gets fed.
  * The neutral stimulus (NS), the bell is rung, the US is given, and the dog responds. (UR.
* After conditioning: the bell is rung, but it is now a conditioned stimulus.  The dog exhibits a conditioned response of salivating.
* Notice NS and CS are the same stimulus, and UR and CR are the same response.
  * The difference is whether conditioning was necessary for the response to be caused by the stumulus.
* Second Order conditioning is also possible:
  * Bell -> Salivation
  * Bell + Square
  * Square -> Salivation<br>
<strong>Extinction</strong><br>
* If the CS is repeatedly presented without the US the learned response will be eliminated.
  * Spontaneous recovery<br>
<strong>Generalization and Discrimination</strong><br>
* <strong>Generalization:</strong> Once a response has been conditioned, similar stimuli can elicit the same response
  * E.g. Different bell tones still produce salivation
* <strong>Discrimination:</strong> Ability to distinguish between similar but distinct stimuli
  * Ex. If a dog shows less salivation to a different bell tone
* John B. Watson - father of behaviourism
  * All behaviours can be explained by conditioning
  * Little Albert:
    * Watson conditioned a baby named Little Albert to exhibit fear whenever he saw a white rat. 
    * At the beginning of the experiment, Little Albert was not afraid of any animal, including white rats.
    * Watson placed the white rat on Albert and clanged a steel bar in front of their face, producing a loud noise and scaring the baby.
    * After six trials, Little Albert exhibited fear upon seeing a white rat, and also generalized the fear to all other animals and furry objects.
    * This experiment was deemed highly unethical.<br>
<strong>What affects classical conditioning?</strong><br>
* <strong>Preparedness:</strong> an organism's evolutionary history can make it easier to learn particular associations
  * More likely to develop associations for particular classes of stimuli
  * More likely to associate illness with food not lights, sounds
  * Experiments have been done with showing people pictures of objects, and giving a small electric shock whenever a certain image shows up.  Experimenters found out that people learned to show fear much faster when conditioned with an image of a snake compared to an image of a flower.  This may be due to evolution; humans were always scared of snakes
    * They also did this with images of guns, and found out that it takes longer to condition than a snake, but shorter than flower.  They inferred this occurred because humans know guns are harmful, but they were not always present in evolutionary history.  And most humans were never harmed by flowers.
