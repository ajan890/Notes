# Week 5
## Visual Processing Streams
* After the visual cortex, information is routed to other cortical areas for processing
  * Dorsal - "Where pathway"
  * Ventral - "What pathway"

### Ventral Pathway
* Important for face processing & object recognition
  * <strong>Visual agnosia:</strong> inability to recognize objects
  * <strong>Prosopagnosia:</strong> inability to recognize familiar faces

### Visual Perception
* <strong>How do we get from 2D to 3D?</strong><br>

  * <strong>Monocular Depth Cues:</strong>
    * Help us perceive depth using one eye<br>

  * <strong>Binocular Depth Cues:</strong>
    * <strong>Retinal disparity:</strong> different retinal imates each eye receives based on its different perspective
    * <em>Convergence:</em> when a person views a nearby object, the eye muscles turn the eyes inward<br>

* <strong>How do we keep our perception of an object constant despite different input?</strong>
  * <strong>Size Constancy</strong><br>

    * The man in blue is the same size in both pictures<br>
  
  * <strong>Brightness Constancy</strong><br>

    * The colors of A and B are the same.  (Cover up the part where they touch!)<br>

## Auditory Systems
### Audition

* Sound enters through the auditory canal, and vibrates the eardrum.  The eardrum amplifies the sound through the cochlea, which vibrates hair cells which send the signal to the brain.

<strong>Sound Localization:</strong><br>
* You can tell where a sound is coming from by comparing the volume the sound you hear in both ears, and also which ear the sound reaches first.

<strong>Multimodal Integration</strong><br>
* <strong>Multipodal perception:</strong> Effect that concurrent stimulation in more than one modality has on perception of events and objects in the world.
  * For exmaple, the <strong>McGurk Effect</strong>
    * What you see may influence what you hear.
  * <strong>Synaesthesia</strong>
    * Condition in which percepual or cognitive activities (i.e., listing to music, reading) triggers exceptional sensory experiences.
