# Week 4
## Neurons
Neurons were first observed by <strong>Santiago Ramon y Cajal</strong>.  A Neuron is a cell that specializes in receiving and transmitting information.<br>

### Parts of a Neuron
* <strong>Cell body:</strong> coordinates information-processing tasks and keeps cell alive
* <strong>Dendrites:</strong> receives information from other neurons and relays it to the cell body
* <strong>Axon:</strong> long slender projection that conducts electrical impulses away from the cell body
  * The axon is covered in a myelin sheath, which is formed of glial cells, that insulates axons resulting in dramatically increased speed of and efficiency of neural connection.<br>
  * The myelin sheath is like wire insulation.
* <strong>Synapse:</strong> the region between the axon of one neuron and the dendrite (or cell body) of another

### How Neurons "Send" and "Receive" Messages
There are two parts to the process:
1. <strong>Action Potential</strong>
  * Hodgkin and Huxley (1952)
    * Used axons in giant squids
    * Discovered that axons are like batteries; they store electric potential in the form of ions.
    * When the neuron is at rest, called <strong>"Resting Potential"</strong>:
      * Outside (+) charged [Na+, Cl-]
      * Inside (-) charged [K+, A-]  (A = anions)
      * Note all of the elements are in different concentrations; the charges cancel, but not completely
      * Resting Potential = -70mV
    * When the axon is stimulated, the cell undergoes <strong>depolarization</strong>; channels open and sodium ions rush in. This makes the charge less negative. This stimulates the next section of the axon and causes it to depolarize too.
    * After some time, the sodium channels close and the potassium channels open, causing potassium ions to rush out, and the cell undergoes <strong>repolarization</strong>.  This causes a drop in voltage.
    * After that, the cell actively transports potassium and sodium to equalize the voltage back to -70mV.

    * <strong>Action potential:</strong> an electrical signal that is conducted along the length of a neuron's axon to a synapse<br>
      * Channels are <strong>voltage-gated</strong>.  They open when the voltage changes, or in other words, when their neighbors open.
      * This is an ALL-OR-NONE phenomena<br>
2. <strong>Transmission across the synapse</strong>
  * The <strong>Synaptic Cleft</strong> is a gap between the synapse terminal of the axon of one neuron, and the dendrites of another neuron.
  * When the action potential reaches the synaptic terminals, it causes the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.
    * Neurotransmitters can be excitatory or inhibitory
      * <strong>Excitatory:</strong> increase the likelihood of an action potential (by causing the membrane potential to be less negative)
      * <strong>Inhibitory:</strong> decrease the likelihood of an action potential (by causing the membrane potential to be more negative)
    * If the neuron receives enough excitory potentials from other neurons so that its voltage sums to be greater than -55mV, then the neuron itself will fire through its axon.
    * A neuron can be artifically fired if it is stimulated using electricity.

### How do we Feel Sensations?
Since neurons fire all or nothing (without a gradient), how do we feel different strengths of feelings?
* Strength is determined by:
  * <strong>Rate</strong> of firing
  * <strong>Number</strong> of neurons firing

### Neurotransmitters
When a neurotransmitter is released, we wouldn't want it to be receied by every nearby neuron.  (That would be painful!)<br>
The binding of neurotransmitters to receptors is specific, like lock and key.<br>

<strong>Some Common Neurotransmitters:</strong><br>
* <strong>Acetylcholine (Ach):</strong> Important transmitter between motor neurons and voluntary muscles
* <strong>Dopamine:</strong> Regulates motor behavior, motivation, pleasure and emotional arousal
  * Degeneration of these neurons in a particular part of brain is linked to Parkinson's
* <strong>Serotonin:</strong> Plays a primary role in regulating sleep and wakefulness and eating behavior

<strong>Types of Neurotransmitters:</strong>
* <strong>Agonist:</strong> chemical that enhances or mimics the action of a neurotransmitter
  > Example: Dopamine agonists can be used against Parkinson's disease
* <strong>Antagonist:</strong> chemical that blocks the action of a neurotransmitter
  > Example: Botox, or Botulinum Toxin, is an Acetylcholine antagonist
* An agonist or antagonist is not necessarily excititory or inhibitory; it depends on the neurotransmitter it mimics.

## How do we Study the Brain?
<strong>MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):</strong>
  * Uses a powerful magnetic field to produce high-quality inmages of the brain and its <strong>structure</strong><br>
<strong>fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging):</strong>
  * Used to examine changes in <strong>ongoing brain activity</strong> by measuring changes in the blood's oxygen levels
  * Great for determining location (i.e., good spatial resolution); not so great at determining timing (i.e., bad temporal resolution)<br>
<strong>EEG (Electroencephalography):</strong> 
  * EEG can record electrical activity from large populations of simultaneously active neurons at the scalp with <em>millisecond</em> resolution
  * EEG is a <em>direct</em> measure of neural activity
  * EEG has good temporal resolution but poor spatial resolution

## Sensation Vs. Perception
 * <strong>Sensation:</strong> The physical processing of environmental stimuli by the sense organs
 * <strong>Perception:</strong> The psychological process of interpreting sensory information
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/215632627-53fb94cb-1cbb-48e3-a3a9-50ac4a6eb2e0.png)<br>
 * Sensation and perception may not exactly align.  For example, "Yanny vs. Laurel."  The recording is the same, but everyone perceives it differently.
 
### Factors that Influence Perception
 * <strong>Psychophysics:</strong> methods that measure the strength of a stimulus and the observer's sensitivity to that stimulus
 * Gustav Fechner created the concept of a <strong>threshold</strong>
   * A threshold is the limit at which someone can sense something
     * Differs depending on the person/animal
     * For example: the quietest sound played that can be perceived.
   * The <strong>Absolute Threshold</strong> is the smallest amount of stimulation needed for detection by a sense, at least 50% of the time.
  * <strong>Just Noticable Difference (JND)</strong>, or <strong>Difference Threshold:</strong> the minimum difference between two stimuli needed to detect a difference between them 50% of the time.  
  * Based on perception, are you more likely to be able to tell the difference between a 10 and 11 lb dumbbell, or a 100 and 101 lb dumbbell?
  * <strong>Perception is influenced by Expectations:</strong>
    * When you expect something, you are more likely to perceive it.<br>
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/215635478-da932fb6-7e93-4443-b58d-6d3c5f938f12.png)<br>
    * Is the center symbol a "B" or "13"?  Well, it depends on which direction you read it.  It is perceived as both depending on what you expect to be in the gap.
    * <strong>Top-down processing:</strong> When our perceptions are influenced by our expectations or by our prior knowledge
    * <strong>Bottom-up processing:</strong> occurs when we perceive individual bits of sensory information (e.g., sounds) and use them to construct a more complex message<br>

    * On the example, just looking at the first image, the character doesn't really look like anything.  If a guess were made, maybe "r", "a", or "s" would be reasonable.  Based on the second image, the letter is either an "a" or an "e", and finally, with the context of the paragraph, top-down processing can be used and the letter is an "e".<br>
 * <strong>Signal detection theory:</strong> response to a stimulus depends on <strong>person's sensitivity</strong> and on a <strong>person's decision criteria:</strong>
   * Person's experience
   * Expectations 
   * Motivation
   * Level of fatigue
   * Consequences of missing <br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/215636616-c1e40ace-d5ed-4d0e-98aa-7b4dc9a32e30.png)
   * E.g., If a radiologist misses signs of cancer in an X-ray scan, it may kill the patient.  Thus, there will be a lot more false alarms instead of correct rejections and misses.
   * If the situation is very low stakes, like you are in the shower and hear something vaguely like your phone, and you aren't expecting important calls, you are much more likely to have a miss or correct rejection.
* <strong>Sensory Adaptation:</strong>
  * Diminished sensitivity as a result of constant or recurring stimuli
    * Phone in pocket, watch, smell on the bus, sound of A/C, etc.
    * This is beneficial because you may not want to keep thinking about the fact that you are wearing pants and miss something much more important, like the bear 10 feet away from you.

* <strong>Attention:</strong>
  * <strong>Selective attention:</strong> focusing on one particular task or event
    * Can come at a cost
    * 1/2 of participants miss the man in the gorilla suit (in that one video)
  * <strong>Inattentional blindness:</strong> A failure to perceive objects that are not the focus of attention
  * <strong>Change blindness:</strong> The failure to detect <em>changes</em> to the visual details of a scene.

## The Five Senses
### Vision - Eyes
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216200230-aa5b61fb-a851-4756-bfc6-0c6fb5eb8338.png)<br>
* Cornea is the outer protective surface of the eye.  The iris is the colored part of the eye, pupil is the hole in which light passes through, the retina is the area in the back of the eye where light is absorbed, and the optic nerve sends the signal to the brain.<br>
* Because of the lens, the image that is projected onto the back of the eye is flipped upside-down.  Your brain corrects for this error.<br>
* Near-sightedness and far-sightedness occurs when the lens fails to focus the image onto the retina.  You are near-signted if the image is focused in front of the retina and far sighted if the light is focused behind the retina.<br>
<strong>The retina:</strong><br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216201374-266d7fb3-7c33-42a9-9400-e540454f77c8.png)<br>
* The retina is where light is observed.  The ganglion cells that absorb light are at the back of the retina; the optic nerve passses in front of it.  This causes a blind spot (which the brain does a good job of covering up) where light is blocked by the optic nerve and does not get absorbed by ganglion cells.  The eye is structured this way because the ganglion cells require blood in order to function.<br>
<strong>Cones and Rods:</strong><br>
* Cones are responsible for seeing color, and rods are responsible for seeing brightness.  An eye typically has about 6 million cones, located near the fovea, or the center of the retina, and about 120 million rods, located in the periphery of the retina.<br>
* The best way to view stars at night is to look to the side of the stars, rather than directly at it.  By doing so, moves the image of the star outside the fovea where all the rods are.<br>
<strong>Trichromatic Color Theory:</strong><br>
* The theory that 3 different cones each sensitive to different wavelengths of light.  (One sees red, one sees green, and one sees blue).<br>
* This theory can be disproben by negative afterimages.<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216203663-4795695e-dd97-46a7-8ac5-5bb8e6b67363.png)<br>
* Staring at the dot at the center of the flag, then at a blank white screen, would create an afterimage with colors red, white, and blue.<br>
<strong>Opponent-Process Theory:</strong><br>
* We perceive color in terms of opposing pairs: red/green, yellow/blue, white/black.<br>
  * Cells that are stimulated by red are inhibited by green - when green is no longer perceived a rebound effect occurs - the previously inhibited cells are free to fire.<br>
  * This explains the negative afterimages, and is presumed to be the correct theory. (until something else disproves it.)<br>
<strong>Color Vision:</strong>
* 2 processes are complementary:
  * Trichromatic -> Level of the cones
  * Opponent process -> Level of ganglion cells, LGN, visual cortex
* Signal travels down optic nerve to brain
* Passes through the thalamus
* Sent to the Primary Visual Cortex
* Neurons that are <strong>feature detectors</strong> respond selectively to specific features.<br>

* After the visual cortex, information is routed to the other cortical areas for processing
  * Dorsal - "Where pathway"
  * Ventral - "What pathway"
