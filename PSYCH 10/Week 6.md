# Week 6
## Memory
<strong>Encoding:</strong> the process of transforming what we perceive, think, or feel into a memory<br>
<strong>Storage:</strong> the information is held in a way that allows it to later be retrieved

## Encoding
### Levels of Processing
* There are three levels of processing.  In this list, they go from shallow to deep.
  1. Physical
    * <strong>Example:</strong> Word: TABLE, is the word written in capital letters?
  2. Acoustic
    * <strong>Example:</strong> Word: CAT, does the word rhyme with "MAT?"
  3. Semantic
    * <strong>Example:</strong> Word: DAFFODIL, is the word a type of plant?
* The deeper the level of processing, the more your brain must focus on the word to answer the question.  At the shallowest level, you only have to observe the word, and you may not even have to know what the word means.  However, at the deepest level, you would have to connect the word with an image.

### Mnemonics
* Strategies for remember large amount of information, usually involving imagining events occurring on a journet or with some other set of memorized cues
  * <strong>Example:</strong> Memory palace

## Storage
<strong>Atkinson-Shiffrin Model (1968)</strong><br>

### Sensory Memory (SM)
* Accurately holds perceptual information for a very brief amount of time
  * Iconic memory (<1s)
  * Echoic memory (3-4s)
* High capacity, very brief<br>

### Short Term Memory (STM)
* limited duration
* ~20 secs (15-30 secs)
* STM can store about 7 Â± 2 chunks
  * What is a chunk?  It is information grouped into a meaningful unit
    * Words are chunks of letters
    * Multi-digit numbers are chunks of single digit numbers
    * Routes are chunks of locations

### Working Memory
  * STM = the "space" used to hold information presently required
  * WM = manipulation of that information for whatever task you are doing<br>

### Long Term Memory (LTM)
* Memory that persists over time without conscious activation
* Events in your life, facts about the world, motor skills, etc.
* "Long term" sometimes means a few minutes-doesn't have to be years
* Can last indefinitely
* Can be retrieved and brought into working memory (but we might lose the ability to access that memory)
