# Week 10
## Group Behavior (Continued)
### Stanford Prison Experiment: Social Roles
* 1971 - Philip Zimbardo
* Why do 'good' people do 'bad' things if placed in a bad situation?
  * 24 male students were recruited for the experiment, half were randomly assigned to be prison guards, and half were randomly assigned to be prisoners.
  * They made the "jail" as realistic as possible, taking place in a basement in Stanford, and the "prisoners" were arrested at their house at the start of the experiment, and the guards were trained by the professor.
  * The first few days were mild, but days in, the guards and prisoners were harassing each other.
* **Possible conclusions:**
  * Example of the power of social roles and how those roles plays out in specific situations
  * Roles, even though randomly assigned, made people do things they could have never imagined
  * Today, this experiment would be deemed highly **unethical**.
* **Potential issues:**
  * Problems with the advertisement for the experiment?
  * Demand characteristics
  * Not really an "experiment", it's a "movie".<br>

### The Bystander Effect
* The failure to offer help by those who observe someone in need when other people are present.
* Famous case: Kitty Genovese - murdered while walking home from work in NYC.
  * 37 people claimed to see the murder did not call the police.
* Darley and Latan√© (1968) study

* The actor (P) and the victim, plus others are placed in a room, and the actor pretends to have a seizure or some medical emergency.  The others are confederates that do not respond, and the victim is timed on how long they take before they get help... or if they do at all.
* They found that the more confederates (other people) they add to the room, the slower the victim waits before getting help.
* Why?
  * Tendency for people to feel diminished sense of responsibility when they are surrounded by other who are acting in the same way.
  * However, that's not the whole story.
    * If 1 person helps, other people will help
    * So it's not just diffusion of responsibility
      * If that was the case you would just walk away
    * Bystander effect may be driven more by **uncertainty**.
* What if YOU are in trouble and in a crowd
  * What can you do to get people to help you?
    * Get 1 person to help and others will follow.
* CCTV studies
  * Actors would "faint" in front of a CCTV camera and observe if people help.  
  * Studies show strangers step in to help 90% of the time.

## Clinical Psychology: Part 1
* Where should we draw the line between being sad and having a clinical diagnosis?
* **DSM** - Diagnostic and statistical Manual of mental Disorders (DSM-V)
  * persistent disturbance or dysfunction in behavior, thoughts, or emotions that causes significant distress or impairment
  * number of symptoms required for diagnosis
### Medical Model
* Psychological disorders have biological and environmental causes, symptoms, and possible treatments
* Not:
  * A punishment
  * Possession
  * Supernatural forces
* Benefits to the DSM
  * Helps to communicate between practitioners
  * Allows for greater standardization of diagnoses
  * Can guide practitioners in selecting the "most effective" treatment option
#### Labelling
* Use a person-centered approach when using diagnostic labels
* People with \_\_\_\_\_\_ Versus \_\_\_\_\_\_ people (or just \_\_\_\_\_\_)
  * Ex. "People with depression" vs. "Depressed people"

---
* Drawbacks to the DSM
  * Labelling/diagnosis can lead to stigma, lower self-esteem, feelings of helplessness.
  * 1 in 5 people will experience mental illness or addiction in a given year, and 67% of those live in silence.
  * Can be problematic if just "below" cut off
  * Systematic diagnosis of mental illnesses can be difficult.<br>

* Diagnoses change over time
  * With attitudes: Before 1973, the DSM classified homosexuality as a mental disorder
  * With advances in research<br>

* Ways of expressing and explaining distress can vary

#### Other approaches: Research Domain Criteria Project (RDoC)
* Views psychological disorders as the result of differences/dysfunction in normal psychological processes
* Focus on studying basic processes/underlying causes of disorders
* Can help explain *comorbidity*
  * Ex. Study response to reward more generally, not just cocaine addiction<br>

### Anxiety 
* Negative mood state accompanied by bodily symptoms such as increased heart rate, muscle tension, a sense of unease, adn apprehension about the future.
* Everyone can be anxious sometimes, but here fear is out of proportion to the risk involved and it interferes with everyday life
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/224861542-b2208603-16d4-4fc0-8892-d43166050539.png)<br>
#### Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)
* Excessive worry about everyday things that is out of proportion to the specific causes of worry
* At *least 6 months* of excessive anxiety
* May be accompanied by:
  * Difficulty concentrating
  * Muscle tension, fatigue
  * Sleep problems
* Worry can be **reinforced**.

#### Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia
* **Recurrent** unexpected panic attacks
* Intense anxiety and avoidance related to the attack for at least 1 month
  * Causing significant distress or interference with life
* May also develop **agoraphobia**, a fear of public places
* Many more people have had a panic attack than fit criteria for disorder.<br>

#### Specific Phobia
* Irrational fear of a specific object or situation that substantially *interferes with the person's ability to function*
* Most common anxiety disorder (12%)
* 5 major subtypes
  * Blood-injury-injection
  * Situational type (planes, elevators, etc.)
  * Natural environment (storms, heights, water)
  * Animal type
  * Other (choking, vomiting)
* Why might phobias be so common?
  * Most targets of phobias can pose real threats!
  * *Preparedness theory*: people are predisposed toward certain fears
    * Easier to condition fear (in humans and in monkeys) for snakes and spiders than flowers or toy rabbits
  * Are phobias learned? (Remember Little Albert, the white rat experiment)
    * Doesn't fully explain behavior - people with phobias are not necessarily more likely to recall negative experiences with feared objects/situation
    * May relate to temperament and neurobiological factors
    
#### Social Anxiety Disorder
* Fear of social situations which leads to worry and diminished day-to-day functioning
  * 2nd most common anxiety disorder
  
### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
* Exposure to a traumatic event
* Chronic **psychological arousal, recurrent unwanted thoughts or images of the trauma and avoidance** of things that call the traumatic event to mind.
  * More than 1 month

### Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
* Obsessive thoughts and/or compulsions that seem irrational or nonsensical
  * Checking, ordering cleansing rituals, repeating
* Take up a significant amount of time (at least 1h per day)
* Cause *significant distress or impairment in function*
* **Obssessions:** unwanted, inappropriate, and persistent thoughts
* **Compulsions:** repetitive, often ritualistic behaviours

### Unipolar Disorders (Depression)
* Major Depressive disorder (MDD)
  * **One or more Major depressive episodes** (MDE) but no history or manic or hypomanic episodes
* A Major depressive episode consists of:
  * **Depressed mood**\*
  * **Anhedonia**\*
  * Weight loss or increase in appetite
  * Insomnia/hypersomnia
  * Agitation/psychomotor retardation
  * Fatigue/loss of energy
  * Worthlessness, excessive or inappropriate guilt
  * Diminished ability to concentrate or indecisiveness
  * Recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal ideation or attempt
* Symptoms occur for at **least 2 weeks** and cause significant **distress or impairment in function**.  Either depressed mood or anhedonia **must** be present every day.
* What contributes to depression?
  * Prevalence = 18%
  * **Biological**
    * Genetics - twin studies
    * Neurotransmitters: serotonin
  * **Psychological**
    * Attribution style: pessimistic attribution style
  * **Social**
    * Stressful life events
    * Interpersonal factors
    * SES
  * **\*Gene x Environment interactions**
    * The 5-HTT gene (Serotonin Transporter) is related to depression.  There are two alleles, a "long" and "short" allele.  They are named that way because of their physical length.
    * This gene does not determine whether someone experiences depression, but if combined with whether a person has been maltreated, there is a correlation.<br>

* Caspi et al., 2003
* They found that those with the two long alleles are more resilent to depression, while those with two short alleles are more affected by maltreatment.
* They also did the same study with the number of stressful life events.<br>

### Bipolar Disorder
* Characterized by cycles of abnormal, persistent high mood (mania) and low mood (depression)
  * *Mania:* Must last at least 1 week
    * Decreased need for sleep
    * Talkativeness
    * Racing thoughts
    * Reckless behavior<br>

#### What contributes to Bipolar disorders?
* **Prevalence = 2.5%**
  * **Biological**
    * Genetics - twin studies
  * **Psychosocial**
    * Life stressors
    * Positive life events -> more manic episodes after life events in which goal is attained.
  
### Schizophrenia
* **Delusions:** False beliefs
  * Persecutory (person believes someone is after them)
  * Grandiose (person has inflated sense of worth)
  * Referential (person believes ordinary events or behavior has some special significance)
* **Hallucinations:** perceptual experiences that occur even when there is no stimulus in outside world generating those experiences.
  * Can be **auditory**, visual, olfactory, gustatory, or somatic
* **Disorganized speech:** speech that is difficult to follow because answers do not clearly follow questions or one sentence does not logically flow from another
* At least two of the following present for at least 1 month:
  * **Delusions**\*
  * **Hallucinations**\*
  * **Disorganized speech**\*
  * **Disorganized or catatonic behaviour**
  * **Negative symptoms**
* At least one of the first three symptoms must be included.<br>
#### Symptoms of Schizophrenia
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/225471110-1c1587b6-5854-4be7-b363-c2e262cdd9f9.png)<br>
* People with schizophrenia also have larger ventricles in the brain.  Ventricles are the fluid-filled areas in the brain.<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/225471594-10ea107f-5e5a-4118-aa36-0cc874383fbd.png)<br>
* Schizophrenics also may have reduced overall brain volume (2% difference).

#### Risk factors for developing schizophrenia
* Prevalence = 1%
* **Biological factors:**
  * Genetics
  * Neurotransmitter/dopamine abnormality
* **Environmental factors:**
  * Issues during pregnancy (stress, infection, malnutrition, hypoxia)

### Psychological Treatment
* Psychological treatments
* Biological treatments
* Can combine

#### Psychoanalytic/psychodynamic therapy
* Goals
  * Reduce inner conflict by giving patients insight into their unconscious thoughts and feelings (Developed by Sigmund Freud)
  * Reveal how childhood experiences have shaped the individual
* **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**
  * Goal: Teach people new, more constructive ways of thinking and acting (i.e., change the cognitions and the behaviors of a disorder)
  * Homework to practice techniques learned in therapy
  
#### Biomedical Therapies
* Psychopharmacology - the study of the effect of drugs on the mind and behavior
* Antipsychotic medication:
  * E.g., Chlorpromazine (Thorazine)
    * Blocks **dopamine** receptor sites (some also affect serotonin systems)
    * Treats some positive symptoms, not negative ones
* Antidepressant medication
  * Commonly: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
  * Makes serotonin stay in the synaptic cleft for longer
    * Fluoxetine (Prozac)
  * Can also treat anxiety and eating disorders
  
#### Combining Therapies
* Are psychological and biological treatments equally effective?
* Do psychological versus biological treatments work in the same way?<br>

* Barriers to Treatment
  * People don't know that they have a treatable disorder
  * Problems finding/affording treatment
  * Beliefs about treatment/stigma
* Preventative Programs
  * Programs that promote well-being and mental health
    * Mindfulness Meditation
    * Peer Support and education
      * Goal setting groups
