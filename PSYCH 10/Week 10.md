# Week 10
## Group Behavior (Continued)
### Stanford Prison Experiment: Social Roles
* 1971 - Philip Zimbardo
* Why do 'good' people do 'bad' things if placed in a bad situation?
  * 24 male students were recruited for the experiment, half were randomly assigned to be prison guards, and half were randomly assigned to be prisoners.
  * They made the "jail" as realistic as possible, taking place in a basement in Stanford, and the "prisoners" were arrested at their house at the start of the experiment, and the guards were trained by the professor.
  * The first few days were mild, but days in, the guards and prisoners were harassing each other.
* **Possible conclusions:**
  * Example of the power of social roles and how those roles plays out in specific situations
  * Roles, even though randomly assigned, made people do things they could have never imagined
  * Today, this experiment would be deemed highly **unethical**.
* **Potential issues:**
  * Problems with the advertisement for the experiment?
  * Demand characteristics
  * Not really an "experiment", it's a "movie".<br>

### The Bystander Effect
* The failure to offer help by those who observe someone in need when other people are present.
* Famous case: Kitty Genovese - murdered while walking home from work in NYC.
  * 37 people claimed to see the murder did not call the police.
* Darley and Latan√© (1968) study

* The actor (P) and the victim, plus others are placed in a room, and the actor pretends to have a seizure or some medical emergency.  The others are confederates that do not respond, and the victim is timed on how long they take before they get help... or if they do at all.
* They found that the more confederates (other people) they add to the room, the slower the victim waits before getting help.
* Why?
  * Tendency for people to feel diminished sense of responsibility when they are surrounded by other who are acting in the same way.
  * However, that's not the whole story.
    * If 1 person helps, other people will help
    * So it's not just diffusion of responsibility
      * If that was the case you would just walk away
    * Bystander effect may be driven more by **uncertainty**.
* What if YOU are in trouble and in a crowd
  * What can you do to get people to help you?
    * Get 1 person to help and others will follow.
* CCTV studies
  * Actors would "faint" in front of a CCTV camera and observe if people help.  
  * Studies show strangers step in to help 90% of the time.

## Clinical Psychology: Part 1
* Where should we draw the line between being sad and having a clinical diagnosis?
* **DSM** - Diagnostic and statistical Manual of mental Disorders (DSM-V)
  * persistent disturbance or dysfunction in behavior, thoughts, or emotions that causes significant distress or impairment
  * number of symptoms required for diagnosis
### Medical Model
* Psychological disorders have biological and environmental causes, symptoms, and possible treatments
* Not:
  * A punishment
  * Possession
  * Supernatural forces
* Benefits to the DSM
  * Helps to communicate between practitioners
  * Allows for greater standardization of diagnoses
  * Can guide practitioners in selecting the "most effective" treatment option
#### Labelling
* Use a person-centered approach when using diagnostic labels
* People with \_\_\_\_\_\_ Versus \_\_\_\_\_\_ people (or just \_\_\_\_\_\_)
  * Ex. "People with depression" vs. "Depressed people"

---
* Drawbacks to the DSM
  * Labelling/diagnosis can lead to stigma, lower self-esteem, feelings of helplessness.
  * 1 in 5 people will experience mental illness or addiction in a given year, and 67% of those live in silence.
  * Can be problematic if just "below" cut off
  * Systematic diagnosis of mental illnesses can be difficult.<br>

* Diagnoses change over time
  * With attitudes: Before 1973, the DSM classified homosexuality as a mental disorder
  * With advances in research<br>

* Ways of expressing and explaining distress can vary

#### Other approaches: Research Domain Criteria Project (RDoC)
* Views psychological disorders as the result of differences/dysfunction in normal psychological processes
* Focus on studying basic processes/underlying causes of disorders
* Can help explain *comorbidity*
  * Ex. Study response to reward more generally, not just cocaine addiction<br>
