## What is Psychology?
<strong>Psychology</strong> is the study of the mind and behavior.  (Literally, "Psycho" - soul, spirit, mind, "Logo" - the study of) <br>

## Some myths in psychology:

> * Left-brained people are more logical and right brained are more creative <br>
> * Different people have different "learning styles" <br>
> * Memories work like video recordings <br>

It turns out that the above "myths" are all false. <br>

It may be true that some people are more logical and some are more creative.  However, there do not exist "left-brained people" and "right-brained people," since everyone uses their entire brain for different tasks.  There is no "one-sided brain dominance." 
It is also true that people have learning <em>preferences</em>.  However, they don't have different learning <em>styles</em>.  It has been proven by experiment that people learn as well in their preferred learning method and other learning methods.
Memories do not work like video recordings.  A common experience is when people meet someone and are given a name, but forget what the name was later. <br>

## Big questions of psychology:

> * How do we learn? <br>
> * How does thinking change over time? <br>
> * How do we associate words and written symbols with objects and concepts? <br>
> * How do others influence us? <br>
> * How do we diagnose and treat mental health issues? <br>

These are the types of questions psychologists try to answer.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the types of questions psychologists ask and <strong>how</strong> they attempt to answer those questions. <br>
2. To learn to critically evaluate psychological research claims and to assess how they could apply to your everyday life. <br>

## Historical Roots of Psychology

  <strong>Psychology is a relatively new science.</strong>  However, the study of the mind does date back to ancient times.<br>


  Ancient Egyptian doctors linked traumatic brain injuries to behavioral changes, and ancient Greek philosophers contemplated the origins of knowledge.<br>

  Ancient Greek physician Hippocrates developed the world's first personality classification:<br>

     alt="Humorism.svg"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" 
     width="300"/><br>
  The idea was that if the four fluids are in balance, then the person is healthy. Otherwise, the person may have certain mental health issues.<br>

  Modern psychology has been influenced by <strong>Philosophy</strong> and the <strong>Sciences:</strong> Physics, Evolution, and Medicine/Physiology.<br>

  ### Influence of Evolution:

  * Evolution by natural selection
    * "Survival of the fittest"
    * <strong>Behaviors</strong> are shaped by natural selection.

  ### Influence of Medicine:

  * Localization of brain function was studied using <strong>Phrenology</strong>
    * People thought that the brain was formed by up to 27 different organs.  Using the same part of the brain over and over again (like exercising) would cause that region to grow bigger.<br>
    * People believed that you can tell someone's personality by just feeling the surface of their scalp, since where the brain bulges would represent the part of the brain the person used the most.<br>
    * Now we know that is not true.<br>
  * Case studies of brain injury
    * One particular case study that is commonly looked at was Phineas Gage.  He was a person whose job was to pack explosives to blow up rocks during the construction of the great railroad.  He received a brain injury when the explosives ignited at an incorrect time and his tamping rod was driven through his skull.<br>
    * He survived the injury, but acted immature or like a child afterwards.<br>
    * This case allowed the frontal lobe of the brain to be linked to impulse control, higher level cognition, and decision making/planning.<br>

  ### Contemporary Psychology

  * Wilhelm Wundt opened the first experimental psychology laboratory.  It was operating in Germany, 1879.<br>
    * Wundt did many reaction time studies.  For example, experiments such as asking the test subject to press a button as soon as possible after hearing a tone.
    
## Schools of thought in Psychology

### Structuralism vs. Functionalism
<strong>Structuralism</strong> is the attempt to analyze conscious experience by breaking it down into basic elements.  <em>How is the mind structured?</em><br>
   * Structuralism was inspired by chemistry.  Like molecules with specific properties are made of elements, Wilhelm Wundt and Edward Titchener believed that all feelings are a combination of certain base feelings called <strong>sensations</strong>.<br>
   * <strong>Introspection</strong>, or the subjective observation of one's own experiences, was used.  For example, an apple can be characterized by some sensations, such as crunch and juiciness, described by how people experience it themselves.<br>
   * The problem with this is that experience is very subjective, and it is difficult to access subconscious aspects of cognition.<br>
   
<strong>Functionalism</strong> is the study of the purpose and function of behaviors and mental processes.<br>
   * Influenced by Darwin's Theory of Evolution
   * Describes what the mind <em>does</em>

###  Behaviorism
   * The study of observable behavior.<br>
   * Behavior is less subjective, and more scientific.<br>
   * Ex. How does a dog behave if you give it a bone? <br>
  
### Cognitive Psychology
   * Became popular more recently (1950's-1960's)<br>
   * Studies mental processes such as how the brain actually works.<br>

### Psychoanalytic Perspective
   * Attempts to explain how behavior and personality are influenced by unconscious processes. <br> 
   * Studied by <strong>Sigmund Freud</strong><br>
   
### Cross-cultural Psychology
   * A field that draws comparisons about individual and group behavior across cultures<br>
   * Psychology is WEIRD.  <strong>W</strong>estern, <strong>E</strong>ducated, <strong>I</strong>ndustrialized, <strong>R</strong>ich, <strong>D</strong>emocratic. <br>
   * Most of the sample are people from the populations described above.  A very common argument in psychology is that the sample is not representative of everyone in the world.  Thus, comparing psychology between cultures is becoming more popular.<br>

<strong>The Burning House Problem:</strong>
   > Imagine you are 30 years old, financially well, and married.  Your mother and spouse are stuck in a burning house and need your help to escape.  However, they are in different rooms, and you can only save one of them.  Who would you save?<br>

* In UCLA, Psych 10 students more often save their mother.<br>
* This test was given to Taiwanese participants and American participants.  All Taiwanese participants were undergraduate students in Taiwan, of Taiwanese descent, and all American participants were undergraduate students in the United States, of European descent. <strong>They found that American participants tend to prefer to save their spouse, and Taiwanese participants tend to prefer to save their mother.</strong><br>
* The difference is with culture.  American culture places a greater emphasis on independence from family, while Taiwanese culture places a greater emphasis on respect for elders.<br>

## What Does Psychology Today Encompass?

There are two types of research, <strong>basic research</strong> and <strong>applied research</strong>.  Although they mostly cover different areas, there is overlap and the distinction is not always clear. <br>

### Basic Research

* <strong>Biological / Physiological / Neuroscience</strong><br>
   * Brain, neurons, neurochemicals<br>
* <strong>Cognitive</strong><br>
   * Thinking, memory, attention<br>
* <strong>Developmental</strong><br>
   * Change over time<br>
* <strong>Social</strong><br>
   * How do people interact?<br>

### Applied Research

* <strong>Clinical</strong><br>
   * Mental Illness<br>
* <strong>Educational</strong><br>
   * Educational techniques, diagnosis<br>
* <strong>Forensic</strong><br>
   * Criminal and legal matters<br>
* <strong>Industrial-organizational</strong><br>
   * In the workplace <br>

### "Isn't psychology just studying the obvious?"
* The media can misinterpret or over-simplify research findings.<br>
* Even things that may seem obvious are still worthy of scientific study<br>
   * More other-race friends -> less prejudice <br>
      * Still need to understand what aspects are beneficial.<br>

### Hindsight Bias
<strong>Hindsight Bias</strong> is the belief that an outcome was foreseeable.<br>
   * "knew it all along" effect<br>
      * "Of course the Lakers were going to win that game!"<br>
      * "Of course ______ was going to win the election!"<br>

Findings seem obvious once we know them, but they were once controversial.
   * Ex.<br>
      > Making errors during learning is <strong>bad!</strong><br>
      > Making errors during learning is <strong>good!</strong><br>

## Scientific Method

The scientific method helps reduce bias. <br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/211949686-4cd91525-b43c-46d9-a6f1-5c2127203fa8.png"
     alt="scientific-method.png"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" 
     width="300"/><br>

* Ex. 
   > <strong>Theory:</strong> Spacing out your learning leads to better retention.<br>
   > <strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Students who spaced out their studying before the Psych 10 exam will perform better than students who "crammed".<br>

<strong>What makes a good theory?</strong><br>
* A good theory must be falsifiable.  <br>
   * <strong>Darwin's Theory of Evolution vs. Freud's Psychoanalytic Theory</strong><br>
   * Darwin's Theory of Evolution can be falsified with concrete evidence gathered by observation. <br>
   * Freud's psychoanalytic theory is not a good theory, since it focuses on subconscious thoughts, which cannot be retrieved accurately.<br><br>
* If findings support the hypothesis then confidence in the theory grows.<br>

<strong>What makes a good hypothesis?</strong><br>
* A good hypothesis must be specific and testable.<br>
   * Can we make this more specific?<br>
      > Drivers who use cell phones more frequently will get in more accidents.<br>
   
   * (Yes.) A better hypothesis would be:<br>
      > Drivers who use cell phones while driving will get in more accidents.<br>

## How we test a hypothesis

### Correlational Designs
A <strong>correlational design</strong> measures how closely two factors/variables vary together, or how well you can predict a change in one variable from observing a change in the other variable.<br>
* <strong>Positive(+) correlation:</strong> both variables either increase or decrease together. <br>
* <strong>Negative(-) correlation:</strong> one variable increases when the other decreases.<br>
* <strong>Zero correlation:</strong> one variable is not predictable related to the other.<br>

<strong>Steps:</strong><br>
1. Formulate a testable hypothesis<br>
   > Internet use in class is negatively related to class performance<br>
2. Select the research method and design the study<br>
   > Research method: Correlational study<br>
      * Operationalize your variables<br>
        * <strong>Operational definition</strong> -> a description of a property in concrete measurable terms.<br>
   > Variables: # minutes spent browsing (non-academic internet use), Grades on final exam<br> 
3. Collect the data<br>
   > Students internet use during a class are monitored, amd their final exam scores are compared.<br>
4. Analyze data and draw conclusions<br>

A correlational design would have correlation coefficients between -1 and 1.<br>

<strong>JUST BECAUSE TWO VARIABLES ARE CORRELATED DOES NOT MEAN ONE CAUSES THE OTHER</strong><br>

### Third Variables
* A third variable is one that could cause both the variables being correlated.  <br>
* Ex.<br>
  * Consider an experiment correlating internet usage in class and test scores.<br>
  * They may be correlated, but the quality of the professor may also influence both variables.<br>
  * This can make the experiment less accurate since many other variables may be present.<br>

### Limitations and Benefits of Correlational Designs
<strong>Limitations:</strong><br>
* Correlation cannot infer causation<br>
  * Issues with directionality and potential third variables<br>

<strong>Benefits:</strong><br>
* Can <em>sometimes</em> be a more ethical approach<br>
* Establishes relationships/makes predictions, can inspire experiments.<br>

### Experimental Designs

In an experimental design, the investigator systematically manipulates a variable (IV) under carefully controlled conditions and observes whether any changes occur in a second variable (DV) as a result.<br>

* <strong>Independent Variable (IV)</strong><br>
   * Factor that is varied or manipulated.<br>
* <strong>Dependent Variable (DV)</strong><br>
   * The behavior that is measured (and is expected to change as a function of change in the independent variable)<br>

In an experimental design, it is important to keep everything else the <em>same</em> across the two levels (or conditions) of the IV.
The other variables are called <strong>control variables</strong>.

<strong>Steps:</strong><br>
1. Formulate a testable hypothesis<br>
  > Children who watch adults display aggressive behavior will subsequently behave more aggressively.<br>
2. Select research method and design the study<br>
  > Research method: Experimental methodology/design<br>
  > Independent Variable: Whether or not the kids saw the adult model aggressive behavior.<br>
  > Dependent Variable: The amount of aggressive behavior kids displayed (measured by kicks, punches, etc.)<br>
  > Control Variables: The room the experiment is done in, the experimenter, the doll, etc.
3. Collect the data<br>
  > Kids are split into two groups, one watches a film of an adult beating up a bobo doll, and the other watches a film of an adult playing with a bobo doll.<br>
  > All other variables must be kept the same: the amount of time kids spent with the bobo doll, the room, the bobo doll, etc.<br>
4. Analyze data and draw conclusions<br>
5. Report the findings<br>

* After watching an adult model show aggression towards the doll, children were aggressive.<br>
* Based on this alone, can we say that watching the adult model <strong>caused</strong> an increase in child aggression?<br>
   * No, because to show that "X causes Y,"  we should measure the behavior (Y) in both the experimental group and the control group.  (Or compare two experimental groups with each other)<br>

### Ensuring the groups are equal

<strong>Random Assignment</strong><br>
   * Assigning participants randomly to experimental conditions<br>
      * Increases the chances that characteristics (eg. age, gender, IQ) will be equally distributed across the groups<br>

<strong>How do we <em>select</em> participants for the study?</strong><br>
   * <strong>Population:</strong> everyone in the group the experimenter is interested in<br>
   * <strong>Sample:</strong> a subset of a population<br>
   * Generalization is important!

<strong>Random Sampling</strong><br>
  * Every person in the population has an equal chance of being selected.<br>
  * <em>Convenience sample:</em> a sample that consists of people who are conveniently available for the study (Not good!)<br>

### Limitations and Benefits of Experimental Designs
<strong>Limitations:</strong><br>
* May be impractical or unethical to address certain types of research questions using an experimental design<br>
* Highly controlled lab settings can make generalization of findings to the real world more difficult<br>

<strong>Benefits:</strong><br>
* CAN infer causation<br>
* Precise control over variables can eliminate alternative explanations<br>

## Recap
What's the difference between experimental and correlational designs?<br>

<strong>Correlation:</strong><br>
* Measures the <strong>strength</strong> of the relationship between two things (-1 to 1).<br>
* Observed<br>
* <strong>Cannot infer causation</strong> (does A cause B, or B cause A, or is there some third variable?)<br>

<strong>Experiment:</strong><br>
* <strong>Experimentally manipulating</strong> an independent variable to see its impact on a dependent variable<br>
* Is controlled (Impact of X on Y while holding Z's constant)<br>
* <strong>Can infer causation</strong> (change an IV <em>potentially</em> <strong>causes</strong> a change in the DV)<br>

# Summary
### Psychology is the study of the mind and behavior.<br>
   * Psychology dates back to the times of ancient Egyptians, and the Greek and Roman Empires, but only recently became a science.<br>
      * Influenced by evolution and medicine.<br>

### Modern psychology has six schools of thought:
   * Structuralism - analyzes conscious experience by breaking it down into basic elements<br>
   * Functionalism - study of the purpose and function of behaviors and mental processes<br>
   * Behaviorism - study of observable behavior<br>
   * Cognitive Psychology - studies mental processes<br>
   * Psychoanalytics - attempts to explain how behavior and personality are influenced by unconscious processes<br>
   * Cross-cultural Psychology - draws comparisons about individual and group behavior across cultures<br>

### Research
Research begins with a theory and the formation of a hypothesis.
* A good theory is one that can be falsified, and a good hypothesis is one that is specific and can be tested.<br>
* To test the hypothesis:
   * <strong>Correlational Designs:</strong><br>
      * Measures how closely two factors/variables vary together<br>
      * Coefficient ranges from -1 to 1<br>
      * Observational study<br>
      * Cannot infer causation<br>
   * <strong>Experimental Design:</strong><br>
      * Experimenter alters independent variable, dependent variable is measured.<br>
      * Is controlled<br>
      * Can infer causation<br>
