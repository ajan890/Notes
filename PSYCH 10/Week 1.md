## What is Psychology?
<strong>Psychology</strong> is the study of the mind and behavior.  (Literally, "Psycho" - soul, spirit, mind, "Logo" - the study of) <br>

## Some myths in psychology:

> * Left-brained people are more logical and right brained are more creative <br>
> * Different people have different "learning styles" <br>
> * Memories work like video recordings <br>

It turns out that the above "myths" are all false. <br>

It may be true that some people are more logical and some are more creative.  However, there do not exist "left-brained people" and "right-brained people," since everyone uses their entire brain for different tasks.  There is no "one-sided brain dominance." 
It is also true that people have learning <em>preferences</em>.  However, they don't have different learning <em>styles</em>.  It has been proven by experiment that people learn as well in their preferred learning method and other learning methods.
Memories do not work like video recordings.  A common experience is when people meet someone and are given a name, but forget what the name was later. <br>

## Big questions of psychology:

> * How do we learn? <br>
> * How does thinking change over time? <br>
> * How do we associate words and written symbols with objects and concepts? <br>
> * How do others influence us? <br>
> * How do we diagnose and treat mental health issues? <br>

These are the types of questions psychologists try to answer.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the types of questions psychologists ask and <strong>how</strong> they attempt to answer those questions. <br>
2. To learn to critically evaluate psychological research claims and to assess how they could apply to your everyday life. <br>

## Historical Roots of Psychology

  <strong>Psychology is a relatively new science.</strong>  However, the study of the mind does date back to ancient times.<br>


  Ancient Egyptian doctors linked traumatic brain injuries to behavioral changes, and ancient Greek philosophers contemplated the origins of knowledge.<br>

  Ancient Greek physician Hippocrates developed the world's first personality classification:<br>

     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" 
     width="300"/><br>
  The idea was that if the four fluids are in balance, then the person is healthy. Otherwise, the person may have certain mental health issues.<br>

  Modern psychology has been influenced by <strong>Philosophy</strong> and the <strong>Sciences:</strong> Physics, Evolution, and Medicine/Physiology.<br>

  ### Influence of Evolution:

  * Evolution by natural selection
    * "Survival of the fittest"
    * <strong>Behaviors</strong> are shaped by natural selection.

  ### Influence of Medicine:

  * Localization of brain function was studied using <strong>Phrenology</strong>
    * People thought that the brain was formed by up to 27 different organs.  Using the same part of the brain over and over again (like exercising) would cause that region to grow bigger.<br>
    * People believed that you can tell someone's personality by just feeling the surface of their scalp, since where the brain bulges would represent the part of the brain the person used the most.<br>
    * Now we know that is not true.<br>
  * Case studies of brain injury
    * One particular case study that is commonly looked at was Phineas Gage.  He was a person whose job was to pack explosives to blow up rocks during the construction of the great railroad.  He received a brain injury when the explosives ignited at an incorrect time and his tamping rod was driven through his skull.<br>
    * He survived the injury, but acted immature or like a child afterwards.<br>
    * This case allowed the frontal lobe of the brain to be linked to impulse control, higher level cognition, and decision making/planning.<br>

  ### Contemporary Psychology

  * Wilhelm Wundt opened the first experimental psychology laboratory.  It was operating in Germany, 1879.<br>
    * Wundt did many reaction time studies.  For example, experiments such as asking the test subject to press a button as soon as possible after hearing a tone.
    
## Schools of thought in Psychology

  * Structuralism vs. Functionalism
    * <strong>Structuralism</strong> is the attempt to analyse conscious experience by breaking it down into basic elements.  <em>How is the mind structured?</em><br>
      * Structuralism was inspired by chemistry.  Like molecules with specific properties are made of elements, Wilhelm Wundt and Edward Titchener believed that all feelings are a combination of certain base feelings called <strong>sensations</strong>.<br>
      * <strong>Introspection</strong>, or the subjective observation of one's own experiences, was used.  For example, an apple can be characterized by some sensations, such as crunch and juicyness, described by how people experience it themselves.<br>
      * The problem with this is that experience is very subjective, and it is difficult to access subconscious aspects of cognition.<br>
    * <strong>Functionalism</strong> is the study of the purpose and function of behaviors and mental processes.
      * Influenced by Darwin's Theory of Evolution
      * Describes what the mind <em>does</em>

   * <strong>Behaviorism</strong> is the study of observable behavior.<br>
      * Behavior is less subjective, and more scientific.<br>
      * Ex. How does a dog behave if you give it a bone? <br>
      
   * <strong>Cognitive psychology</strong><br>
      * Became popular more recently (1950's-1960's)<br>
      * Studies mental processes such as how the brain actually works.<br>
   
   * <strong>Psychoanalytic Perspective</strong><br>
      * <strong>Psychoanalytic theory</strong> attempts to explain how behavior and personality are influenced by unconscious processes. <br> 
      * Studied by <strong>Sigmund Freud</strong><br>
   
   * <strong>Cross-cultural psychology</strong> is a field that draws comparisons about individual and group behavios across cultures<br>
