# Week 4
## Neurons
Neurons were first observed by <strong>Santiago Ramon y Cajal</strong>.  A Neuron is a cell that specializes in receiving and transmitting information.<br>

### Parts of a Neuron
* <strong>Cell body:</strong> coordinates information-processing tasks and keeps cell alive
* <strong>Dendrites:</strong> receives information from other neurons and relays it to the cell body
* <strong>Axon:</strong> long slender projection that conducts electrical impulses away from the cell body
  * The axon is covered in a myelin sheath, which is formed of glial cells, that insulates axons resulting in dramatically increased speed of and efficiency of neural connection.<br>
  * The myelin sheath is like wire insulation.
* <strong>Synapse:</strong> the region between the axon of one neuron and the dendrite (or cell body) of another

### How Neurons "Send" and "Receive" Messages
There are two parts to the process:
1. <strong>Action Potential</strong>
  * Hodgkin and Huxley (1952)
    * Used axons in giant squids
    * Discovered that axons are like batteries; they store electric potential in the form of ions.
    * When the neuron is at rest, called <strong>"Resting Potential"</strong>:
      * Outside (+) charged [Na+, Cl-]
      * Inside (-) charged [K+, A-]  (A = anions)
      * Note all of the elements are in different concentrations; the charges cancel, but not completely
      * Resting Potential = -70mV
    * When the axon is stimulated, the cell undergoes <strong>depolarization</strong>; channels open and sodium ions rush in. This makes the charge less negative. This stimulates the next section of the axon and causes it to depolarize too.
    * After some time, the sodium channels close and the potassium channels open, causing potassium ions to rush out, and the cell undergoes <strong>repolarization</strong>.  This causes a drop in voltage.
    * After that, the cell actively transports potassium and sodium to equalize the voltage back to -70mV.

    * <strong>Action potential:</strong> an electrical signal that is conducted along the length of a neuron's axon to a synapse<br>
      * Channels are <strong>voltage-gated</strong>.  They open when the voltage changes, or in other words, when their neighbors open.
      * This is an ALL-OR-NONE phenomena<br>
2. <strong>Transmission across the synapse</strong>
  * The <strong>Synaptic Cleft</strong> is a gap between the synapse terminal of the axon of one neuron, and the dendrites of another neuron.
  * When the action potential reaches the synaptic terminals, it causes the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.
    * Neurotransmitters can be excitatory or inhibitory
      * <strong>Excitatory:</strong> increase the likelihood of an action potential (by causing the membrane potential to be less negative)
      * <strong>Inhibitory:</strong> decrease the likelihood of an action potential (by causing the membrane potential to be more negative)
    * If the neuron receives enough excitory potentials from other neurons so that its voltage sums to be greater than -55mV, then the neuron itself will fire through its axon.
    * A neuron can be artifically fired if it is stimulated using electricity.

### How do we Feel Sensations?
Since neurons fire all or nothing (without a gradient), how do we feel different strengths of feelings?
* Strength is determined by:
  * <strong>Rate</strong> of firing
  * <strong>Number</strong> of neurons firing

### Neurotransmitters
When a neurotransmitter is released, we wouldn't want it to be receied by every nearby neuron.  (That would be painful!)<br>
The binding of neurotransmitters to receptors is specific, like lock and key.<br>

<strong>Some Common Neurotransmitters:</strong><br>
* <strong>Acetylcholine (Ach):</strong> Important transmitter between motor neurons and voluntary muscles
* <strong>Dopamine:</strong> Regulates motor behavior, motivation, pleasure and emotional arousal
  * Degeneration of these neurons in a particular part of brain is linked to Parkinson's
* <strong>Serotonin:</strong> Plays a primary role in regulating sleep and wakefulness and eating behavior

<strong>Types of Neurotransmitters:</strong>
* <strong>Agonist:</strong> chemical that enhances or mimics the action of a neurotransmitter
  > Example: Dopamine agonists can be used against Parkinson's disease
* <strong>Antagonist:</strong> chemical that blocks the action of a neurotransmitter
  > Example: Botox, or Botulinum Toxin, is an Acetylcholine antagonist
* An agonist or antagonist is not necessarily excititory or inhibitory; it depends on the neurotransmitter it mimics.

## How do we Study the Brain?
<strong>MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):</strong>
  * Uses a powerful magnetic field to produce high-quality inmages of the brain and its <strong>structure</strong><br>
<strong>fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging):</strong>
  * Used to examine changes in <strong>ongoing brain activity</strong> by measuring changes in the blood's oxygen levels
  * Great for determining location (i.e., good spatial resolution); not so great at determining timing (i.e., bad temporal resolution)<br>
<strong>EEG (Electroencephalography):<strong> 
  * EEG can record electrical activity from large populations of simultaneously active neurons at the scalp with <em>millisecond</em> resolution
  * EEG is a <em>direct</em> measure of neural activity
  * EEG has good temporal resolution but poor spatial resolution
