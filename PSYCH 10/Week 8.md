# Week 8
### Misinformation Bias
* **Loftus & Palmer, 1974**
* Showed participants a slideshow of a car accident happening in slow motion
* Asked three groups of participants
  > About how fast were the cars going when they `verb` each other?<br>
  * The verb is either "smashed", "hit", or "contacted"
* What they found was that the speed the participants estimated was influenced by the verb they used.<br>

#### Long-Term Effects of Misinformation
* One week later, the subjects were asked, "Was there glass on the ground after the accident?"
  * 14% of the "hit" group said yes
  * 34% of the "smashed" group said yes
* There actually was no glass.

## Decision Making
* Involves evaluating alternatives and making choices among them
### Availability Bias
* Items that are more readily available in memory are judged as having occurred more frequently.
* Example:
  * Participants were asked to estimate their chance of winning the lottery.
    * Most answered around 1 in 2-3 million, although the actual number is 1 in 41 million.

### Framing Bias
* Consider this example: Choose the better medical plan:
  * If program A is adopted 200 people will be saved.
  * If program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that 600 people will be saved, and a 2/3 probability that no people will be saved.
* Now, choose the better one here:
  * If program A is adopted 400 people will die.
  * If program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that no people will die, and a 2/3 probability that 600 people will die.
* Most people choose program A in the first one and program B in the second.  However, both problems are the same.  Why is this?
* **Framing effects:** changing how an issue is presented can change people's decisions.
  * People tend to want to "cash their earnings" and would not gamble on the first question.
  * However, on the second, people are more willing to gample because killing 400 people is seen as a bad thing.
* Same as asking "Would you rather have a 10% chance of mortality or a 90% chance of survival?" (They are the same)
* **Loss aversion:** people tend to want to avoid losses more than they want to achieve gains.

#### Sunk-Cost Fallacy
* You buy an expensive ticket to a show.  On the day of the show, however, you feel very sick.  Do you still go?
  * Most people would still go because the ticket is expensive.
* However, if it was phrased as 
  > Spend $100 + recover comfortably at home<br>
  > Spend $100 + suffer with your sickness at the concert<br>
* More people choose to stay at home

### Anchoring Effect
* **Anchoring:** the bias to be affected by an initial anchor, even if the anchor is arbitrary, and to insufficiently adjust our judgements away from that anchor.
* For example:
  * Sales at clothing stores - you are more willing to buy a sweater at priced at $40 if they told you the original price was $70.
  * Sticker price at car dealers - you always try to bargain down the price, but will fail to lower the price as much because of the anchor.
* This works even if the "anchor" is completely irrelevant!
* Examples:
  * Ask a participant to draw a line, then ask them to estimate how long a river is by pointing to it on a map. 
    * People who drew longer lines tend to guess higher
  * Ask a participant to spin a roulette wheel, and then estimate how many countries are in the UN.
    * Those who scored a higher roll tend to guess higher
 
## Language and Thought
### What is Language?
* Language is a **system** that relates **sounds** (or gestures) to **meaning**
  * Symbolism
    * Connecting symbols to meaning
  * Structured and meaningful
    * Example
      > "The cat sat on the fence" is not the same as "The fence sat on the cat."
  * Displacement
    * Indicating want
  * Generativity
    * You only learn some sentences but can generalize to create infinitely many others.

### Components of Language
1. **Phonemes**
  * The smallest unit of sound
    * /p/ vs /b/
      * pit vs bit
2. **Morphemes**
  * The smallest unit of meaning
    * Prefix 'Un' means not
    * Suffix '-s' means more than 1
      * 'sub' 'marine'

3. **Syntax**
  * Rules for word combinations
    > The cat chased the dog. <br>
    > The dog was chased by the cat. <br>

### How do infants learn language?
#### Theories of Language Development
* **More Nurture?**
  * Learn language from the environment
  * E.g., Behaviorists
* **More Nature?**
  * Children are born with innate mental structures that guide their acquisition of language
  * E.g., Noam Chomsky

* **Support for Nativist Perspective:**
  * Children apply rules of grammar to novel words (e.g., wug)
  * There seem to be critical (or sensitive) periods to learn language
  * Animals don't learn language as readily or successfully as humans

#### Early Speech Production
* Birth - Crying
* 1 Month - Cooing (vowel sounds)
* Middle of first Year - Babbling (consonant sounds)
* End of first year - Patterned Speech (random sounds, but patterned)
* 18 Months - Naming Explosion (children begin assigning words to meaning extremely quickly, 10-20 words per day)
* 24 Months - Combining words (may not be grammatical)

#### Early Speech Perception
* **Categorical Speech Perception**
  * Infants, like adults, perceive speech sounds categorically
  * e.g., although the acoustic difference between /b/ and /p/ falls on a continuum - we perceive these consonants as two distinct categories
* Infants take statistics on the sounds they hear.<br>

* Infants learning Japanese would learn the Japanese /r/ sound, while those learning English would learn the distinction between the English /r/ sound and the English /l/ sound.
* **Perceptual Narrowing for phonemes**
  * 6- to 8- month old English learners can differentiate the Salish and Hindi contrasts. 
  * By 10 - 12 months they lose this ability.
  * Is this a bad thing?
    * Studies have shown that the earlier infants do this, the larger their vocabularies by age 2.

#### Language and Cognition
* Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis
  * Found that Inuit people had many words for "snow."
    * **Kriplyana:** snow that looks blue in the early morning.
    * **Hiryla:** snow in beards.
    * **Ontla:** snow on objects.
    * **Intla:** snow that has drifted indoors.
  * Strong version:
    * thoughts and behavior are <em>determined</em> by language
    * the language you speak determines the concepts and categories that you use, and, as a result, shapes what you <em>can</em> think about.
  * Weak version:
    * thoughts and behavior are <em>influenced</em> by language
    * language influences what we pay attention to and this shapes experience, which influences how we think
* Do psychologists really believe the strong version is true?
  * Not really. Some languages have very few words for color, but can still color match, etc.
  * Most psychologists believe in a weaker hypothesis: languages <em>influences</em> our <em>habitual</em> thinking about the world
    * **Example:** The word "key" in Spanish is a feminine noun and in German is a masculine noun.  In an experiment, experimenters asked Spanish and German people to describe keys, and what they found was the Spanish people would describe it using more feminine-related adjectives such as "beautiful," "ornate," etc. while Germans would describe it using more masculine-related adjectives such as "jagged," "metal," etc.
    * **Example:** Russian Blues - Russian has two words for blue.  Light blue in English is referred to as "goluboy", and dark blue is "siniy".  Experimenters asked Russian speakers and English speakers to identify which squares are identical and measured the reaction time.<br>

    * Russians answered faster in the Cross-Category trials while English speakers showed no difference.
## Developmental Psychology
* **Developmental Psychology:** the scientific study of changes or continuities in an organism between initial conception and death
### Perceptual Development
* Perceptual experience begins in utero
#### Auditory Development
  * Mother's voice is most salient external stimulation that reaches the fetus
    * Speech is low-pass filtered
  * Newborns prefer to listen to
    * their mother's voice over another woman's voice
    * their mother's native language over another language
  * The acoustics of a newborns' cry exhibits distinctive characteristics of the mother's native language
  * Young infants recognize stories and music they were exposed to while still in the womb.
#### Taste Development
  * Amniotic fluid is flavored by what the mother has eaten
  * Infants show preferences for flavors they were exposed to in utero
  * Experimenters have tested this before: they told one group of mothers in their third trimester to drink a set amount of carrot juice every day on top of normal water consumption, and the other group to drink a set amount of water every day on top of normal water consumption.
    * After the baby is born for ~5 months, they have the baby eat cereal in carrot juice.  Those that were exposed to carrot juice in utera responded more positively.
### Infant Testing Methods
  * Infants can't tell us about their perceptual experiences
  * We must <em>infer</em> their perceptual abilities and preferences based on their behavior.
  * Most infant testing methodologies are based on 3 assumptions:
    1. Infants will attend/orient to stimuli they prefer or find interesting
    2. Infants prefer to hear/see stimuli that they have heard/seen before (familiarization)
    3. If they have been repeatedly exposed to a stimulus (to the point of boredom) then they should prefer novel stimuli (habituation)<br>

  * **High Amplitude Sucking Procedure (HASP)**
    * Babies are given a sucker attached to a pressure sensor.  When they are given something novel or something they are interested in, the babies tend to suck harder.<br>

#### Visual Development

* Infants cannot see clearly when they are born; they have about 20/800 vision.  This means they can see at 20 feet someone with perfect vision can see at 800 feet.
* This improves very fast.  By about 5 months of age, the babies have around the same vision as an adult.
* **Fantz, 1961**
  * Invented the Preferential Looking paradigm
  * Premise: Infants will look longer at interesting stimuli than uninteresting stimuli<br>
  * If infants show a preference for the striped stimuli over the solid color stimuli then they can **see** the difference!
    * Stripes start big and gradually get smaller, and if the infant stops showing preference for one, it means the infant can no longer see the stripes because they are blurry enough to look like the solid color.<br>

* **Preferences for Faces**
  * 3-month-olds show preferences for faces their own race.
    * They aren't racist!
    * They do this because their caregivers tend to be people of their own race.
### Cognitive Development
* **Cognitive development:** the development of thinking across the lifespan.
* Children can think but they may overgeneralize or may not notice certain things.
  * For example, a child may see a butterfly and say it's a bird, since it flies.  Or, the child may ask Mom over the phone to look at the picture they drew, although Mom cannot see the picture.
* Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development
  * Children are like "little scientists"
    * They are naturally curious
    * That plays an active role in acquiring knowledge
  * **Schema:** an organized unit of knowledge that the child uses to try to understand a situation
    * A "bird" schema may be associated with "fly," "alive," "wings."
  * **Assimilation:** new experiences are readily incorporated into child's existing theories
  * **Accommodation:** theories are modified based on experience<br>
