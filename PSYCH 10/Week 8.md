# Week 8
### Misinformation Bias
* **Loftus & Palmer, 1974**
* Showed participants a slideshow of a car accident happening in slow motion
* Asked three groups of participants
  > About how fast were the cars going when they `verb` each other?<br>
  * The verb is either "smashed", "hit", or "contacted"
* What they found was that the speed the participants estimated was influenced by the verb they used.<br>

#### Long-Term Effects of Misinformation
* One week later, the subjects were asked, "Was there glass on the ground after the accident?"
  * 14% of the "hit" group said yes
  * 34% of the "smashed" group said yes
* There actually was no glass.

## Decision Making
* Involves evaluating alternatives and making choices among them
### Availability Bias
* Items that are more readily available in memory are judged as having occurred more frequently.
* Example:
  * Participants were asked to estimate their chance of winning the lottery.
    * Most answered around 1 in 2-3 million, although the actual number is 1 in 41 million.

### Framing Bias
* Consider this example: Choose the better medical plan:
  * If program A is adopted 200 people will be saved.
  * If program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that 600 people will be saved, and a 2/3 probability that no people will be saved.
* Now, choose the better one here:
  * If program A is adopted 400 people will die.
  * If program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that no people will die, and a 2/3 probability that 600 people will die.
* Most people choose program A in the first one and program B in the second.  However, both problems are the same.  Why is this?
* **Framing effects:** changing how an issue is presented can change people's decisions.
  * People tend to want to "cash their earnings" and would not gamble on the first question.
  * However, on the second, people are more willing to gample because killing 400 people is seen as a bad thing.
* Same as asking "Would you rather have a 10% chance of mortality or a 90% chance of survival?" (They are the same)
* **Loss aversion:** people tend to want to avoid losses more than they want to achieve gains.

#### Sunk-Cost Fallacy
* You buy an expensive ticket to a show.  On the day of the show, however, you feel very sick.  Do you still go?
  * Most people would still go because the ticket is expensive.
* However, if it was phrased as 
  > Spend $100 + recover comfortably at home<br>
  > Spend $100 + suffer with your sickness at the concert<br>
* More people choose to stay at home

### Anchoring Effect
* **Anchoring:** the bias to be affected by an initial anchor, even if the anchor is arbitrary, and to insufficiently adjust our judgements away from that anchor.
* For example:
  * Sales at clothing stores - you are more willing to buy a sweater at priced at $40 if they told you the original price was $70.
  * Sticker price at car dealers - you always try to bargain down the price, but will fail to lower the price as much because of the anchor.
* This works even if the "anchor" is completely irrelevant!
* Examples:
  * Ask a participant to draw a line, then ask them to estimate how long a river is by pointing to it on a map. 
    * People who drew longer lines tend to guess higher
  * Ask a participant to spin a roulette wheel, and then estimate how many countries are in the UN.
    * Those who scored a higher roll tend to guess higher
