# Week 8
### Misinformation Bias
* **Loftus & Palmer, 1974**
* Showed participants a slideshow of a car accident happening in slow motion
* Asked three groups of participants
  > About how fast were the cars going when they `verb` each other?<br>
  * The verb is either "smashed", "hit", or "contacted"
* What they found was that the speed the participants estimated was influenced by the verb they used.<br>

#### Long-Term Effects of Misinformation
* One week later, the subjects were asked, "Was there glass on the ground after the accident?"
  * 14% of the "hit" group said yes
  * 34% of the "smashed" group said yes
* There actually was no glass.

## Decision Making
* Involves evaluating alternatives and making choices among them
### Availability Bias
* Items that are more readily available in memory are judged as having occurred more frequently.
* Example:
  * Participants were asked to estimate their chance of winning the lottery.
    * Most answered around 1 in 2-3 million, although the actual number is 1 in 41 million.

### Framing Bias
* Consider this example: Choose the better medical plan:
  * If program A is adopted 200 people will be saved.
  * If program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that 600 people will be saved, and a 2/3 probability that no people will be saved.
* Now, choose the better one here:
  * If program A is adopted 400 people will die.
  * If program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that no people will die, and a 2/3 probability that 600 people will die.
* Most people choose program A in the first one and program B in the second.  However, both problems are the same.  Why is this?
* **Framing effects:** changing how an issue is presented can change people's decisions.
  * People tend to want to "cash their earnings" and would not gamble on the first question.
  * However, on the second, people are more willing to gample because killing 400 people is seen as a bad thing.
* Same as asking "Would you rather have a 10% chance of mortality or a 90% chance of survival?" (They are the same)
* **Loss aversion:** people tend to want to avoid losses more than they want to achieve gains.

#### Sunk-Cost Fallacy
* You buy an expensive ticket to a show.  On the day of the show, however, you feel very sick.  Do you still go?
  * Most people would still go because the ticket is expensive.
* However, if it was phrased as 
  > Spend $100 + recover comfortably at home<br>
  > Spend $100 + suffer with your sickness at the concert<br>
* More people choose to stay at home

### Anchoring Effect
* **Anchoring:** the bias to be affected by an initial anchor, even if the anchor is arbitrary, and to insufficiently adjust our judgements away from that anchor.
* For example:
  * Sales at clothing stores - you are more willing to buy a sweater at priced at $40 if they told you the original price was $70.
  * Sticker price at car dealers - you always try to bargain down the price, but will fail to lower the price as much because of the anchor.
* This works even if the "anchor" is completely irrelevant!
* Examples:
  * Ask a participant to draw a line, then ask them to estimate how long a river is by pointing to it on a map. 
    * People who drew longer lines tend to guess higher
  * Ask a participant to spin a roulette wheel, and then estimate how many countries are in the UN.
    * Those who scored a higher roll tend to guess higher
 
## Language and Thought
### What is Language?
* Language is a **system** that relates **sounds** (or gestures) to **meaning**
  * Symbolism
    * Connecting symbols to meaning
  * Structured and meaningful
    * Example
      > "The cat sat on the fence" is not the same as "The fence sat on the cat."
  * Displacement
    * Indicating want
  * Generativity
    * You only learn some sentences but can generalize to create infinitely many others.

### Components of Language
1. **Phonemes**
  * The smallest unit of sound
    * /p/ vs /b/
      * pit vs bit
2. **Morphemes**
  * The smallest unit of meaning
    * Prefix 'Un' means not
    * Suffix '-s' means more than 1
      * 'sub' 'marine'

3. **Syntax**
  * Rules for word combinations
    > The cat chased the dog. <br>
    > The dog was chased by the cat. <br>

### How do infants learn language?
#### Theories of Language Development
* **More Nurture?**
  * Learn language from the environment
  * E.g., Behaviorists
* **More Nature?**
  * Children are born with innate mental structures that guide their acquisition of language
  * E.g., Noam Chomsky

* **Support for Nativist Perspective:**
  * Children apply rules of grammar to novel words (e.g., wug)
  * There seem to be critical (or sensitive) periods to learn language
  * Animals don't learn language as readily or successfully as humans

#### Early Speech Production
* Birth - Crying
* 1 Month - Cooing (vowel sounds)
* Middle of first Year - Babbling (consonant sounds)
* End of first year - Patterned Speech (random sounds, but patterned)
* 18 Months - Naming Explosion (children begin assigning words to meaning extremely quickly, 10-20 words per day)
* 24 Months - Combining words (may not be grammatical)

#### Early Speech Perception
* **Categorical Speech Perception**
  * Infants, like adults, perceive speech sounds categorically
  * e.g., although the acoustic difference between /b/ and /p/ falls on a continuum - we perceive these consonants as two distinct categories
* Infants take statistics on the sounds they hear.<br>

* Infants learning Japanese would learn the Japanese /r/ sound, while those learning English would learn the distinction between the English /r/ sound and the English /l/ sound.
* **Perceptual Narrowing for phonemes**
  * 6- to 8- month old English learners can differentiate the Salish and Hindi contrasts. 
  * By 10 - 12 months they lose this ability.
  * Is this a bad thing?
    * Studies have shown that the earlier infants do this, the larger their vocabularies by age 2.

#### Language and Cognition
* Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis
  * Found that Inuit people had many words for "snow."
    * **Kriplyana:** snow that looks blue in the early morning.
    * **Hiryla:** snow in beards.
    * **Ontla:** snow on objects.
    * **Intla:** snow that has drifted indoors.
  * Strong version:
    * thoughts and behavior are <em>determined</em> by language
    * the language you speak determines the concepts and categories that you use, and, as a result, shapes what you <em>can</em> think about.
  * Weak version:
    * thoughts and behavior are <em>influenced</em> by language
    * language influences what we pay attention to and this shapes experience, which influences how we think
* Do psychologists really believe the strong version is true?
  * Not really. Some languages have very few words for color, but can still color match, etc.
  * Most psychologists believe in a weaker hypothesis: languages <em>influences</em> our <em>habitual</em> thinking about the world
