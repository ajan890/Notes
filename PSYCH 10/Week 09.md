* Developed by Piaget
### Sensorimotor Stage
* Infants progresss from simple reflex actions to symbolic processing
* Develop an understanding of **object permanence**.
  * Object permanence is the understnading that objects continue to exist when they are no longer visible.
  * Around 9 months of age infants will search for hidden objects
* Violation of Expectations
  * Originated because people questioned whether Piaget's object permanence test gave valid results - infants may know the object is there, just do not bother reaching for it.
  * Infants will look longer at events that violate their expectations (surprising or impossible)
  * Able to test object permanence in infants even younger (3 months instead of 9 months)
  * The experiment:
    * Baillargeon, 1986, 1991
    * An infant is familiarized with a toy car, a ramp, and a Mickey Mouse figurine.
    * They are then given an expected and unexpected event.  
      * The expected event, they put the Mickey Mouse figure behind the track (so the car passes in front), block the area of vision of the infant, and roll the car down the ramp.  The car passes behind the covering but in front of the figurine, and comes out the other side.
      * The unexpected event, they put the Mickey Mouse figure on the track, cover it up, and roll the car down the ramp.  The car this time seems to pass through the figurine, by one of the experimenters moving it.
      * The infant looks at the unexpected event for a longer time, showing they do have object permanence, because if they didn't, they would not question the unexpected event.

### Preoperational Stage
* Can mentally represent objects and think symbollically
* **Limitations**
  * Difficulty with logical reasoning/problem solving
  * Difficulty representing the psychological experiences of others
  * **Conservation** - understanding that altering an object's physical appearance does not change its quantitative properties (liquid, number, mass, volume, etc.)

    * Children do NOT pass conservation tasks until 6 to 7 years of age
    * Why do preoperational children have difficulty?
      * Centration (focus only on one specific physical aspect, such as height)
      * Lack reversibility (can't reverse the steps)
    * Do you think the demands of this task might mask children's true abilities?
      * Verbal demanding
      * Transformation is superficial
  * **Three Mountains Task**

    * Three paper-mache mountains are placed on a table.  The child is allowed to familiarize themselves with the mountains from different angles.
    * They are then asked what would the teddy bear see from its perspective.
    * Most children would describe their own perspective - they are *egocentric*.
    * Children do NOT pass the three mountains task until 7 to 8 years of age.
    * Do you think the demands of this task might mask children's true abilities?
      * Spatial abilities
      * Memory
      * Verbally demanding
      
### Concrete Operational Stage
* Pass conservation tasks and can think logically about concrete situations
* **Limitations**
  * Reasoning is limited to real, present objects
  * Difficulty with tasks that require mental manipulation.
    * For example, if you give them hypothetical problems, they are unable to solve them
    * Also problems that require memory.  For example, "A is taller than B, B is taller than C, who is tallest?"

### Formal Operational Stage
* Become capable of flexible and abstract thought
* Essentially, the child is capable of logical thinking like an adult, although they might not be as capable on more memory intensive or complex problems

### Piaget's Contributions
* Founded the discipline of cognitive development
* **Explained**, not *just described*, development
* **Criticisms of Piaget**
  * May have underestimated children's abilities
  * Vague with respect to the processes and mechanisms of change
  * Stage model doesn't account for ariability in children's performance
  * Undervalues the influence of sociocultural environment

## Social Psychology
* **Social psychology:** concerned with the way individuals' *thoughts*, *feelings*, and *behaviours* are influenced by *others*
* Social cognition
  * How do we understand & evaluate others?
* Group Behavior
  * How do we behave around others?

### Social Cognition
#### Evaluating Others
  * How skilled are we in evaluating others?
  * How do we make these first impressions and what are the implications?
  * Experiment: Evaluations of Professors
    * Ambady and Rosenthal, 1993
    * University students were given 10-second clips of a professor teaching without volume.  They are then tasked to rate the professor on 15 different dimensions.
    * They found that the grades given from the 10-second clips do in fact correlate with student ratings of the professor in the course evaluations.
  * Participants were surprisingly *accurate* in their evaluations of teachers based on *thin-slices* of behaviour
    * Accurary = ability to predict end of year evaluations
  * This can be done with many other factors
    * Rule and Ambady, 2008, 2010, 2011
    * Ambady, Hallahan, Conner, 1999
    * Sexual Orientation
      * Apparently members of the LGBTQ+ community are better at this
    * Political Orientation
    * Future success of lawyers based on college year book photos
#### Stereotypes
* Stereotypes can be:
  * Inaccurate
  * Overused
    * Ex. Men generally can do more pull ups than women, only ON AVERAGE
    * Crossing category boundaries makes things seem more different, and we underestimate variability within categories
  * Can lead to bias
  * Can lead to **Stereotype threat:** fear of confirming a negative stereotype about their social group
#### Impression Formation Task
* A list of people and a description of what they have done is shown on a screen, as well as which group they are in (A or B).
* After the list, participants are asked to tell which group do they think is smarter on average.
* Participants tend to have a more positive view of members of group A than members of group B.
* Group A (n = 26 members) had 18 positive and 8 negative statements. (9:4 ratio)
* Group B (n = 13 members) had 9 positive and 4 negative statements. (9:4 ratio)
* **Illusory correlation:** when people estimate that they have encountered more confirmation of an association between social traits then they have actually seen.
  * Minority group attention grabbing
  * Negative evvents attention grabbing
  * When both occur together it is extra attention grabbing, which skews our perception of frequency
  * This can be one of the ways that we form stereotypes!
  * Impressions of others can be biased by illusory correlations.

#### Recap: Evaluating Others
1. How skilled are we in evaluating others?
  * Judgements can be made *quickly* and with some *degree of accuracy*.
2. How do we make these evaluations and what are the implications?
  * schemas, stereotypes
  * illusory correlations
* Experiencing discrimination impacts health outcomes
* We can be biased even if we don't think we're biased.

#### IAT - Implicit Association Test
* Measures the "strength" of association between 2 concepts or categories<br>

* Can be used to measure one's implicit bias.
* Some strategies can be used to reduce negative impact of stereotypes and bias.<br>

* One way is through contact and friendship
  * Facilitates learning about the outgroup (a group that is different than you)
  * Reduction in fear and anxiety

#### Fast Friends: Friendship in a Lab
* Researchers had participants take IATs based on many different aspects, such as race, political beliefs, etc.
* They then chose the most polar opposite of people and put them in a lab, where they are tasked to work together to do something, e.g., assemble furniture.
* Afterwards, they talk about their beliefs with each other.
* They found out that months later, participants had less biases against other groups.

### Group Behavior
* In class: professor asks everyone to try patting your head and rub your tummy at the same time.  Everyone does it.  Why?
* **Obedience:** the tendency to do what an authority figure tells you to do
* **Conformity:** the tendency to do what others do simply because others are doing it

#### Solomon Asch Experiment: Conformity
* Participants were asked to say out loud which of the three lines matched the line on the left<br>

* **Method**
  * 7 confederates
    * 3rd trial confederates began saying unexpected line
    * Confederates gave incorrect answer on 12 trials
* **Results**
  * 75% of participants went along with the norm at least once (and gave the wrong answer)
  * On average people conformed on 1/3 of 12 trials
* Why did people conform in the Asch experiment?
  * **Normative influence:** conformity results from a concern for what other people think of us.
  * **Informational influence:** conformity results from feeling the group is giving them useful information
  * What factors influences conformity?
    * Presence of an ally decreases conformity
    * People conform less when confederates will not hear their responses
    * Number of confederates

#### Milgram Experiment: Obedience
* If an authority figure told you to harm someone would you?
* Participants were told that the experiment was about the effects of punishment on memory
* Experiment was rigged so participant was always chosen to be the "teacher" and a confederate "learner"
* Participants read a series of word pairs and tested the learner on their memory
* For each incorrect response, the participant was told to administer a shock, increasing the voltage after each wrong answer.  The participant could not see the confederate learner, but they could hear the "pain."  If the participant complained to the experimenter, they were told to just continue with the experiment.
* When people were asked to make predictions on how many people would go all the way to the end of the experiment, they predicted 0.1% of people would go to the end, while actually 65% went to the end.

* **Results:** 65% continued to the end
* **Ethical considerations:** 
  * Participants were intensely stressed during the experiment
  * Follow-up questionnairt responded that they were glad they participated and thought similar experiments should be conducted in the future
* **Variations on Milgram**
  * Closeness of confederate (learner)
  * Closeness of experimenter
  * Respectability of environment
  * Number of other "teachers"
* Original experimental was all male participants: Females and males had similar rates of obedience
* Disposition of the situation
  * When people do bad things, is it because they are "bad apples" or because they are in a "bad barrel"?
