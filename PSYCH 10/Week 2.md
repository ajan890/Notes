## Other Considerations in Experiments

First of all, some examples.<br>

<strong>Example 1</strong><br>
Bill’s mom told him that taking vitamin C will cure a cold. The very next time Bill caught a cold he drank three glasses of orange juice every day for 5 days. Orange juice contains vitamin C. At the end of the fifth day, Bill’s cold was gone. Bill concluded that vitamin C cures colds. <br>
<strong>How much do you agree with this conclusion?</strong> <br>

<strong>Example 2</strong><br>
A teacher feels better when wearing bright colors. She hypothesizes that wearing brightly colored clothing can also improve the mood of people around her. She tests this using her students. She wears dull clothing to her morning class of 45 students and brightly colored clothing to her afternoon class of 45 students. She reports that her afternoon class seemed more alert and smiled more. She concludes that wearing bright colors improves other peoples’ moods. <br>
<strong>How much do you agree with this conclusion?</strong><br>

In both of the examples above, there is not sufficient evidence to support the conclusion, because there are other variables that were not considered.  For the first example, Bill never did a trial where he recovered without Vitamin C.  He has no basis for comparison between having orange juice and not.  For the second example, the time of day is different.  There could be a difference between the students since they may just naturally be more energetic towards the middle of the day.<br>
