## Other Considerations in Experiments

First of all, some examples.<br>

<strong>Example 1</strong><br>
Bill’s mom told him that taking vitamin C will cure a cold. The very next time Bill caught a cold he drank three glasses of orange juice every day for 5 days. Orange juice contains vitamin C. At the end of the fifth day, Bill’s cold was gone. Bill concluded that vitamin C cures colds. <br>
<strong>How much do you agree with this conclusion?</strong> <br>

<strong>Example 2</strong><br>
A teacher feels better when wearing bright colors. She hypothesizes that wearing brightly colored clothing can also improve the mood of people around her. She tests this using her students. She wears dull clothing to her morning class of 45 students and brightly colored clothing to her afternoon class of 45 students. She reports that her afternoon class seemed more alert and smiled more. She concludes that wearing bright colors improves other peoples’ moods. <br>
<strong>How much do you agree with this conclusion?</strong><br>

In both of the examples above, there was not sufficient evidence to support the conclusions, because there are other variables that were not considered.  For the first example, Bill never did a trial where he recovered without Vitamin C.  He has no basis for comparison between having orange juice and not.  For the second example, the time of day is different.  There could be a difference between the students since they may just naturally be more energetic towards the middle of the day.<br>

### Placebo Effect
* When receiving special treatment or something new affects human behavior.<br>
* Typically, a control group is needed to account for the placebo effect.<br>

### Experimenter Bias
* The experimenter's expectations influence the outcome of a study<br>
  * Experimenters might "see" what we want to "see"<br>
  * Experimenters might behave/treat participants differently<br>

### Demand Characteristics
* Participants form an interpretation of the experiement's purpose and subconsciously change their behavior to fit that interpretation.<br>
  * Can be cause by the experimenter's expectations<br>
  * Can be from the participant<br>
  * E.g. Hawthorne Effect<br>

### Biases in the Experiment
* <strong>Ex. </strong> Does priming with elderly stereotypes make you walk more slowly?<br>
* Experimental condition:: "Florida", "retired", "lady", "vacationed", "store"<br>
* Control condition: "put", "mat", "dishes", "sink", "clean"<br>
* Dependent Variable: How fast participants walked down the hall<br>
* <strong>Result:</strong>Participants primed with elderly stereotype were <strong>slower to walk</strong> down the hall.<br>

* However, the experiment was biased, and a later study by Bargh, Chen, and Burrows in 1996 showed that there was no relationship.<br>

### Are the above fatal flaws?
* Often published work attempts to mitigate for these factors
  * Many results replicate across samples
    * Ones that don't (house file) are interesting for that reason
  * Most carefully designed experiments have procedures that reduce the likelihood experimenter bias and demand characteristics
    * Reading from a script
    * Double-blind (or naive experimenter)
  * These are often not major "limitations" of real studies

## Quasi-Experimental Designs
* Similar to experimental research but there is no random assignment to conditions
* Relies on existing group membership (gender, married vs. single, age groups)
* Can't infer causality
* <strong>Example:</strong> the Mother vs. Spouse question from last time
  * This is a quasi-experimental design because:
    * No random assignment
      * (I can't assign you to a race)
    * Still have an independent variable, but you are not directly manipulating it
    * Could be confounding variables
