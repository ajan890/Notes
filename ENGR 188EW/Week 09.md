# Week 9
## Research Ethics, from Academia to Business
### Introduction
* This presentation takes as its basis the National Research Council’s booklet *On Being a Scientist* which was published most recently in 2009.
* Unfortunately, the booklet is heavily biased towards the academic research endeavor, and especially the biological sciences and medicine.
* We have expanded on the themes of On Being a Scientist and expanded its discussion to included not only academia (using the examples in the book), but outward to include problems that practicing engineers might encounter in either academia or in industry or government, especially in the commercial product research, development and design endeavor.
### Advising and Mentoring
* *On Being A Scientist:*
  > All researchers have had advisers; many are fortunate to have acquired mentors as well. An adviser oversees the conduct of research, offering guidance and advice on matters connected to research. A mentor—who also may be an adviser—takes a personal as well as a professional interest in the development of a researcher. A mentor might suggest a productive research direction, offer encouragement during a difficult period, help a beginning researcher gain credit for work accomplished, arrange a meeting that leads to a job offer, and offer continuing advice throughout a researcher’s career. Many successful researchers can point to mentors who helped them succeed.<br>
* If you’re headed into industry or government, your first advisor will probably be your immediate supervisor. He or she will guide you through your first year or two in the organization. Remember, however, that your supervisor’s primary interest is the project, not necessarily you, so may keep your eye open for a mentor somewhat removed from your own group.
* If you’re headed to Graduate School:
  * Get both an advisor (who will guide you as you progress through the mysteries of getting a graduate degree AND a mentor (a separate person who can guide you through the other mysteries of the University and on into the real world.
  * I suggest getting both since there may be circumstances where your Advisor’s suggestions to you might not be in your best interests, and it’s helpful to have an extra shoulder to cry on.

### The Treatment of Data
* *On Being A Scientist:*
  > In order to conduct research responsibly, graduate students need to understand how to treat data correctly. In 2002, the editors of the Journal of Cell Biology began to test the images in all accepted manuscripts to see if they had been altered in ways that violated the journal’s guidelines. About a quarter of the papers had images that showed evidence of inappropriate manipulation. The editors requested the original data for these papers, compared the original data with the submitted images, and required that figures be remade to accord with the guidelines. In about 1 percent of the papers, the editors found evidence for what they termed “fraudulent manipulation” that affected conclusions drawn in the paper, resulting in the papers’ rejection.<br>
* **Examples:**
  * Takata Airbags
  * GM Ignition Module
  * BART
  * Volkswagen Emissions Defeat Device
  * DC-10
  * Shuttle *Columbia*
  * Theranos
 
### Mistakes and Negligence
* *On Being A Scientist:*
  > All scientific research is susceptible to error. At the frontiers of knowledge, experimental techniques often are pushed to the limit, the signal can be difficult to separate from the noise, and even the question to be answered may not be well defined. In such an uncertain and fluid situation, identifying reliable data in a mass of confusing and sometimes contradictory observations can be extremely difficult. Furthermore, researchers sometimes have to take risks to explore an innovative idea or observation. They may have to rely on a theoretical or experimental technique that is not fully developed, or they may have to extend a conjecture into new realms. Such risk taking does not excuse sloppy research, but it should not be condemned as misguided. Finally, all researchers are human. They do not have limitless working time or access to unlimited resources. Even the most responsible researcher can make an honest mistake in the design of an experiment, the calibration of instruments, the recording of data, the interpretation of results, or other aspects of research.<br>
* **Examples:**
  * Citicorp Building:
    * LeMessurier's failure to fully communicate detailed notes of the building's characteristics to his New York office.

### Research Misconduct
* *On Being A Scientist:*
  > Some research behaviors are so at odds with the core principles of science that they are treated very harshly by the scientific community and by institutions that oversee research. Anyone who engages in these behaviors is putting his or her scientific career at risk and is threatening the overall reputation of science and the health and welfare of the intended beneficiaries of research. Collectively these actions have come to be known as scientific misconduct. A statement developed by the U.S. Office of Science and Technology Policy, which has been adopted by most researchfunding agencies, defines misconduct as “fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results.”<br>
  * Fabrication is "making up data or results."
  * Falsification is "manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record."
  * Plagiarism is "the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit."
* **Examples:**
  * Jan Hendrik Schon - AT&T
  * Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
  * Michael LeCour - UCLA Graduate Student
  * UCLA Dental School Faculty Member

### Suspected Violations of Professional Standards
* *On Being A Scientist:*
  > Science is largely a self-regulating community. Though government regulates some aspects of research, the research community is the source of most of the standards and practices to which researchers are expected to adhere. Self- regulation ensures that decisions about professional conduct will be made by experienced and qualified peers. But for self-regulation to work, researchers must be willing to alert others when they suspect that a colleague has violated professional standards or disciplinary practices. To be sure, reporting that another researcher may have violated the standards of science is not easy. Anonymity is possible in some cases, but not always. Reprisals by the accused person and by skeptical colleagues have occurred in the past, although laws prevent institutions and individuals from retaliating against those who report concerns in good faith. Allegations of irresponsible behavior can have serious consequences for all parties concerned.<br>
* **Examples:**
  * Hwang-Seoul National University
  * Endovascular Technologies - Seven anonymous employees
  * Guidant Defibrillator
    * Engineers have knowledge of failures but no whistleblowing

### Human Participants and Animal Subjects
* *On Being A Scientist:*
  > Any scientist who conducts research with human participants needs to protect the interest of research subjects by complying with federal, state, and local regulations and with relevant codes established by professional groups. These provisions are designed to ensure that risks to human participants are minimized; that risks are reasonable given the expected benefits; that the participants or their authorized representatives provide informed consent; that the investigator has informed participants of key elements of the study protocol; and that the privacy of participants and the confidentiality of data are maintained.<br>
* **Examples:**
  * World War II German and Japanese Violations
  * U.S. Atomic Energy Commission radionuclide exposure (1940s-50s)
  * Tuskegee Syphilis experiments (1930s-1972)

### Laboratory and Industrial Safety
* *On Being A Scientist:*
  > In addition to human participants and animal subjects in research, governmental regulations and professional guidelines cover other aspects of research, including the use of grant funds, the sharing of research results, the handling of hazardous materials, and laboratory safety. These last two issues are sometimes overlooked in research, but no researcher or scientific discipline is immune from accidents. An estimated half million workers in the United States handle hazardous biological materials every day. A March 2006 explosion at the National Institute of Higher Learning in Chemistry in Mulhouse, France, killed a distinguished researcher and caused $130 million in damage.<br>
* *On Being A Scientist* is largely silent on the issue of laboratory safety.
* This is an unfortunate oversight, since laboratory safety is important not only in the research arena, but also in the commercial research, design, and manufacturing fields.<br>

* California OSHA Report
  > “The testimony obtained in this case clearly establishes that University accepted the fact that many Principal Investigators consistently failed to enforce the use of personal protective equipment within their labs as “part of the
  culture”. In fact, as the University’s former Manager of Chemical Safety, William Peck, candidly admitted, ‘...It was kind of common knowledge that laboratory people don’t use the proper PPE when they are in the lab... it was hard to convince the professors that they needed to...and if the professors didn’t enforce it, nobody did. Because...EH&S didn’t enforce things like that.’<br>
  > Not only did the University permit Principal Investigators to violate safety regulations without consequence, the University also failed to exercise any reasonable diligence to verify whether an incoming Principal Investigator had the requisite ability to comply with University policy and other mandated safety regulations, prior [to] permitting the PI to undertake research and supervise personnel.”<br>

### Sharing of Research Results
* *On Being A Scientist:*
  > In the 17th century, many scientists kept new findings secret so that others could not claim the results as their own. Prominent figures of the time, including Isaac Newton, often avoided announcing their discoveries for fear that someone else would claim priority. The solution to the problem of making new discoveries available to others while assuring their authors credit was worked out by Henry Oldenburg, the secretary of the Royal Society of London. He won over scientists by guaranteeing both rapid publication in the society’s Philosophical Transactions and the official support of the society if the author’s priority was questioned. Oldenburg also pioneered the practice of sending submitted manuscripts to experts who could judge their quality. Out of these arrangements emerged both the modern scientific journal and the practice of peer review.<br>
* Academia - within reason - there's usually a battle to publish first, both for recognition and for financial reasons
* In industry - need for reasonable protection, but subject to abuse (Theranos)

### Authorship and the Allocation of Credit
* *On Being A Scientist:*
  > When a paper is published, the list of authors indicates who has contributed to the work. Apportioning credit for work done as a team can be difficult, but the peer recognition generated by authorship is important in a scientific career and needs to be allocated appropriately. Authorship conventions may differ greatly among disciplines and among research groups. In some disciplines the group leader’s name is always last, while in others it is always first. In some scientific fields, research supervisors’ names rarely appear on papers, while in others the head of a research group is an author on almost every paper associated with the group. Some research groups and journals simply list authors alphabetically.

### Intellectual Property
* *On Being A Scientist:*
  > Discoveries made through scientific research can have great value— to researchers in advancing knowledge, to governments in setting public policy, and to industry in developing new products. Researchers should be aware of this potential value and of the interest of their laboratories and institutions in it, know how to protect their own interests, and be familiar with the rules governing the fair and proper use of ideas. In some cases, benefiting from a new idea may require establishing intellectual property rights through patents and copyrights, or by treating the idea as a trade secret. Intellectual property is a legal right to control the application of an idea in a specific context (through a patent) or to control the expression of an idea (through a copyright). Patent and copyright protections are legal mechanisms that seek to strike a balance between private gains and public benefits. They give researchers, nonprofit organizations, and companies the right to profit from a new idea. In return, the property owner must make the new idea public, which enables others to build on the idea.
* **Examples**
  * The **Atanasoff-Berry Computer** was the first electronic digital computer, conceived of and built at Iowa State College in Ames, Iowa in 1937-1938.  In 1940, John Mauchley visited Ananasoff, took some notes, and returned to Philadelphia. World War II began.  Atanasoff turned to war-related work, and Mauchley began work of what would become the ENIAC Army-sponsored computer at the University of Pennsylvania. After the War, Machley filed numerous patents, in his own name, on the ENIAC and formed his own firm to market electronic computers.  In 1967, the Honeywell Corporation, an electronic computer firm, brought suit against Sperry-Rand, the successor of Mauchley’s firm. After a long trial in Minneapolis – the longest and most complex trial in the history of the federal judiciary – Judge Larson ruled in 1972 that Mauchey had “derived” his ideas directly from Ananasoff’s original design, and that Mauchley’s ENIAC patents were therefore invalid; the judge therefore invalidated most of the ENIAC patents, leaving Sperry-Rand with nothing.

### Conflicts of Interest
* *On Being A Scientist:*
  > Researchers have many interests, including personal, intellectual, financial, and professional interests. These interests often exist in tension; sometimes they
clash. The term “conflict of interest” refers to situations where researchers have interests that could interfere with their professional judgment. Managing these situations is critical to maintaining the integrity of researchers and science as a whole. Conflicting interests arise in many ways. A researcher who wants to start a company to commercialize research results generated in the laboratory might feel pressure to compromise the progress of students by having them work on company-related projects that are less related to their academic interests. A researcher might need to decide whether to publish a series of narrowly focused papers that woul build the researcher’s record of publication but not help the field progress as quickly as would a single paper containing the researcher’s main conclusions. Or a researcher might have to decide whether to accept a grant to do routine work that will help the researcher financially but may not help the researcher’s career or the careers of the students in the research group

  * University of Texas Oil and Gas Hydraulic Fracturing Study ("Fracking")
  * Pennsylvania State University Fracking Study
