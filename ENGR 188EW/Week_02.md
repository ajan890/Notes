# Week 2
### Case Analysis - Challenger II



* Challenger II exploded after launching and killed all seven crew members onboard the spacecraft.
* The explosion was caused by fuel leaking through an O-ring.

This is a cross-section of the ring; it is rotated around the y-axis to form a full circle.



* This is a diagram of the field joint, the part that holds the solid fuel thrusters together.  They were needed because the thrusters were built and transported in modules and had to be connected together.
* Roger Boisjoly was part of the engineering team that designed the field joint and had known about the issue with the O-rings before the launch.  He pushed to form a team dedicated to fixing the joint, but did not succeed.  He stated that 

    > “I prepared and presented a six-page overview of the joints and the seal configuration to approximately 130 technical experts on October 7, 1985.  However, I was given strict instructions, which came from NASA, not to express the critical urgency of fixing the joint but only to emphasize the joint improvement aspect during my presentation.”

* The day of the launch was below freezing and caused cold air to sink down through the solid fuel thruster.  This caused the temperature sensors to read incorrectly, which caused hotter fires, which blew the O-ring.  On the launchpad, there was visibly black smoke leaking out of the thruster, but they launched anyway.
* Afterwards, their company wrote a report analyzing the O-ring failure, as well as statements on conditions that must be met to launch.
* The field joint was also redesigned (passive responsibility)

* The redesign guarantees that the propellant will be kept warm.


### Case Analysis - Columbia



* During launches, the foam on the Columbia space shuttle was flaking off.  The foam pieces were popcorn-sized, so they did not really do anything about it, since what harm can a tiny piece of foam do?
* However, despite the size, the foam is traveling downward relative to the shuttle at a few hundred miles per hour, and striking the shuttle below, which was made of ceramic tile.

* This image from the NYTimes depicts the spots on the shuttle that were damaged from foam hits.  The engineers were concerned of the damage but the NASA administrators were not interested.  They just simply dismissed the problem and said there was nothing they could do about it.
* There was a debate on whether it was safe to send the astronauts on a damaged shuttle, or should they ask for assistance from the US Air Force.
* They could have saved the astronauts by rushing the construction of new parts to replace the damaged ones, but chose not to.
* As a result, the entire crew died in an explosion and replacing the space shuttle was $1.7B.


## Normative Ethics


### Virtue Ethics (probably on test)



1. Desired characteristics that express a value that is worth striving for.
2. Expressed in action.
3. Lasting and permanent - they form a lasting structural foundation for future action.
4. While always present, they are expressed only when necessary.
5. They can be influenced by the individual.
* (MacIntyre, 1984)
* Virtue ethics present in one’s individual life may differ from those expressed in a business setting
    * Contrast, in your own mind, a list of personal virtues (and vices) and how that list might change within engineering practice.
* Historically, virtue ethics evolved primarily from:
    * Greek Virtue Ethics
        * Temperance, Prudence, Courage, Justice
    * Roman Virtue Ethics
        * Wisdom, Greatness of Spirit, Decorum, Justice, Liberality
    * Christian Virtue Ethics
        * Temperance, Prudence, Courage, Justice, Faith, Hope, Love
    * Late 20th Century reintroduction


### Case Study: The Citicorp Center, NYC 1977



* Typically presented (textbook, chapters 3 and 9) as a classic case of a perfectly resolved engineering ethics case.
* It’s not that simple: the case is much more nuanced than being a simple “success.”
* It is perhaps best to divide the Citicorp case into three segments:
    * Conceptual design, final design and testing, construction, and post
    * LeMessurier’s reanalysis and phone calls
    * The emergency response

--- 



* St. Peter’s Lutheran Church was on the corner of 54th and Lexington, and they didn’t want to sell.  However, Citicorp wanted the entire block to themselves to develop.
* The deal was that Citicorp would demolish the church and rebuild it, but Citicorp gets the air rights.  
* Citicorp ended up building over the church

* Because of this type of building, traditional steel frame construction was not possible - Citicorp could not place a steel frame on the church grounds since they did not own the land.
* The solution was a 59-story building on stilts, with the major structural element in the center of each face of the building
* Thus, outside of the concrete core of the building, almost all occupiable space was cantilevered over the church and sidewalks
* Structural stability was achieved by the use of “chevrons” which transferred the load of the floors (in nine-floor units) to the central members.


#### LeMessurier Acts



* The building requires many, many chevrons to distribute the weight from the sides to the center, and by the building’s design, they had to be welded to each floor for the building to be stable.  However, due to the size of the chevrons and the number of chevrons, they made a last minute change and decided to use bolts instead - it saves half a million dollars and a month of construction.  Due to poor communication, the city assumed that the angled parts were trusses rather than chevrons, which did not have a safety factor, and they signed off the new blueprint.  (Typically, buildings in New York City had a 2:1 safety factor, meaning that if you wanted to support 1000 tons of weight, the design had to be capable of supporting 2000 tons.)  The welding would have provided the structural support, but the bolts would not.
* Two decades later, a Princeton student, Diane Hartley chose the building to write about in her senior thesis.  She noticed that there was something wrong with the joints and the fact that they did not have enough bolts.  She calls one of the junior engineers that worked on the building and word was passed up to LeMessurier. He analyzed every joint on the building where the chevrons met with a floor, and found that the building would not stand in a hurricane.  He confessed, and corrected the error.
* After this, the building was fixed by welding steel “band-aids” onto each connection of the building.
* There were many ethical failures, including but not limited to failure to communicate, failure to analyze quarterly winds, failure to check the safety factors before switching to bolts, etc.  However, LeMessurier confessed at the end, essentially an act of virtue.
* At this point, everyone that had to know about the event knew about the event, including the mayor, governor, local hospital workers, red cross, etc., in case an evacuation had to be made due to a hurricane.


### Rights Ethics 



* John Locke and the Enlightenment:
    * Humans are given “unalienable rights,” including life, liberty, and property.
    * Changed to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” by Jefferson.
* Rights ethics are seen in the Declaration of Independence of the United States, as well as the Bill of Rights.  For example, the fourth amendment prohibits the government from searching your property without a valid search warrant.  This also means that evidence that is found without a warrant cannot be counted as evidence to be used against you in court.  This also includes social media posts, especially if they are private.
* With what the government does, do they help the people more, or harm the people more? 
* Government has the power to fix a problem very quickly if something happens; like shut down a manufacturing plant on short notice.
