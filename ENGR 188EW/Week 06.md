## We Will Consider
* Explosive Growth of Human Population
* Human Needs vs. Limited Resources
* The Attack on our Natural Environment
* Evolution of Environmental Ethics
* Roles of Technology and Engineering
* The Future

## Humans are Recent Arrivals
* Statistics:
  * Earth: ~6 Billion Years
  * Multicell Biota: ~600 Million Years
  * Human Beings (Homo Sapiens): ~2 Million Years
  * 1 Billion People: ~200 Years
* World Population jumped (Orders of magnitude) with each technological era:
  * Three **Technological Eras:** 
    1. Tool Making  ~500B.C.E.
    2. Agricultural  ~1700C.E.
    3. Industrial  ~Present

### Population Growth Factors
* Agricultural
  * Anumal Domestication
  * Intensive Crop Production
* Urbanization
  * Shelter and Transport
  * Water and Energy
  * Sanitation and Health Services
* Industrialization
  * Economic Growth
  * Food and Medical Products
  * Broal Distribution
* Biological
  * Hospitalization: Isolation of illness
  * Medical: Cleanliness, Infection Prevention, Treatment
  * Fertility: Sustenance, Health, (Affluence)
  * Longevity: Infant Survival, Affluence

### Fertility Trends

* Fertility rate is the average number of child births per woman.
* Above ~2.1 is growth, below ~2.1 is decline
* At 1990 growth rate
  * 110B in 2100
  * 700B in 2150
* Developed nations at 0 or - growth
* Developing nations also dropping but still +
* Predictions depend on a large number of assumptions
* **Since the 1960s, total global fertility rates have been cut in half.**
* Interrelationships between resources, population, industrial output, and pollution are complex.

### Population Predictions
* Range of Prediction
  * 7 to 12B by 2050
  * 5.6 to 20.6B by 2100
* Low estimate requires global fertility at less than 2 in 15 years
* Large amount of uncertainty, particularly in out years.

### Resource Consumption

* Consumption is high, and getting higher.
* Increasing faster than population

### Limited Resources
#### Water
![image](https://github.com/ajan890/Notes/assets/66571533/bab1b3da-c39f-4ad8-a318-1c302de449e7)

* Water availability:
  * 33% is base flow
    * 23% is accessible
    * 10% is remote
  * 67% is flood runoff
* We are near limits of presently accessible resources
* Need to use
  * Base flow from more remote area
  * Flood runoff resource
  * Other sources, e.g. ocean desalinization, reclaimed water
#### Land
![image](https://github.com/ajan890/Notes/assets/66571533/efa65691-0578-4a40-9938-81a5ed066ad0)

* Land resources:
  * Are insufficient at present yields
  * Sufficiency means:
    * More land under cultivation
    * At least double present yields
  * Land is acquired by deforestation and/or improved irrigation
  * Yields can be increased by biotechnology - but possibly at a cost

### Energy
#### US Energy Production 2009-2018

* Energy consumption:
  * Steep increase in the last 70 years
  * Mostly from increased use of hydrocarbons
  * Influenced by:
    * Development
    * Climate
    * Affluence
  * Present resources mainly non-renewable and limited
![image](https://github.com/ajan890/Notes/assets/66571533/ecb04d08-60c3-4e48-bafa-8882bfa0ef11)
  * We need lots of coal, but coal is a heavy polluter
  * Need better coal and alternative energy forms

#### US Coal Production 1950-2018

### Resource Overview
* Energy
  * Consumption is increasing
  * Conventional resources are decreasing
* Water
  * Overall use: 6x in 100 years (vs. 2x population growth)
  * Agriculture: Uses 70% of total
  * Human consumption: Inadequate drinking supplies
    * 40% of world faces drinking water shortages
    * 1 billion people lack access to safe drinking water
    * 2.2 million die annually from contaminated water
* Food
  * Developing countries: 2100 to 2700 Cal/day
  * industrial countries: 3000 to 3400 Cal/day
  * Capacity to produce is nearing limits
 
#### Resource Impact is Disproportional
* Impact = PAT
  * Population
  * Affluence
  * Technology
* United States
  * 5% population
  * 25% impact

#### Cost of Affluence: E.g. in Water
* 1 lb grain takes 450 liters of water
* 1 hamburger takes 6200 liters of water
* 1 steak takes 12400 liters of water
* They all have about the same caloric value.

### Cars Are An Important Resource Consumer
* Transport Energy
  * World = 20%
* Car % of Transport
  * USA = 90%
  * Europe = 80%
  * Japan = 60%
* Number of Cars
  * 2000 = ~450 Million
  * 2030 - ~1 Billion
* For equal % of overall energy
  * 2030 = 3x Efficiency (60 mpg)
  * 2100 = 20x Efficiency (400 mpg)
* Developing world is the key area of concern (Cars are less efficient)
* The general trend is that heavier cars have lower fuel efficiency.
* Electric cars are not better; energy still has to come from somewhere
* Some older cars have higher mpg than today:
  * Citroen 2CV: 50+ mpg, 1948-1988
  * Vespa Motor Scooter, 75+ mpg, 1946-?
* Or even older, Schwinn bicycles - carries an entire family and takes no gas.

### Resource Impact is Earthwide
* Ecological Footprints
  * USA = 12.4 acres/person
  * 3rd World = 1.2 acres/person
* To extend today's USA footprint to everyone would require 3 to 4 planet Earths
* But Earth's essential ecology is under siege
  * Increasing population
  * Increasing affluence
  * Increasing needs and wants

### The Tragedy of the Commons\*
* A ‘commons” is a resource not individually owned, but one that is available for use by all
* Adam Smith’s theory that a free market is optimal appears flawed when applied to a commons
* Governments, organizations and people seemingly act in ways that endanger or destroy the commons – unless they are regulated or otherwise motivated
* Overpopulation is an example: People expand local population without regard for the ultimate effect on common resources -- until other personal considerations and/or regulations prevail

* Garrett Hardin, "The Tragedy of the Commons," Science, 162(3859), Dec. 13, 1968

### Common Components in Danger
* Non-renewable resources:
  * Fossil fuels
  * Mineral Ores
  * Topsoil
* Water: Pollution including ground aquifers
* Forests: Wood and Oxygen production
* Atmosphere: Pollution and Climate change
* Oceans and coral reefs: Food, sea-life and beauty
* Wilderness: Refuges, wetlands and scenery
* Species: Biodiversity and biological resources

### An Emerging Ecological Ethic
* New System Concepts
  * Ecosystem as a whole
  * Finite limits on resources
  * Ecological stability
  * Ecological sustainability - Long time spans
* New Views of Nature
  * Holistic and interdependent vs. dualistic and mechanistic
  * Influenced by science - Darwin, DNA, biology, etc.
  * And by religion - Stewardship, the sacredness of nature
* Biocentric Ethical Philosophy
  * Rights and welfare of whole biotic community
  * Long term duties to future generations

### The Uses of Technology
* Understanding what is happening
  * Sensors, data processing
  * Computer models, simulations, prediction
  * Communication, publication...
* Developing alternative technologies to mitigate and eliminate dangers
  * Energy
  * Water
  * Food
  * Transportation
  * Health Care
  * Etc.

### Roles and Duties of Engineers
* Analysis
  * Measuring and analyzing current situation
  * Prediction future conditions
  * Developing new technologies
* Innovation and Development
  * Improving current technologies
  * Creating new the strategies for a sustainable environment
* Communication
  * To policy makers
  * To the non-technical public

## Summary
* Major increases are occurring in the world's population and in people's economic aspirations
* As a result, there are significant stresses on our common resources, environment and ecology
* Technology and engineering are central - both to creating these problems and to solving them
* The next 25 to 50 years will be critical
* Predicting the future outcome is difficult

# Environmental Ethics
* The environment affects:
  * Lives today
  * The future of humanity
  * Future species
  * The Earth itself
* Many environmental problems are the result of society's technical advances, so engineers and scientists must solve them considering traditional ethical frameworks.

## Major Environmental Problems
* Urbanization and Industrialization
  * Smog and air quality
  * The Ozone Layer
  * Climate Change
  * Wastes and Contamination
  * Natural Resource Utilization

### Los Angeles Smog
* Serious problems in the years after World War II, and peaked in the early 1950s
* Los Angeles' Control of Smog:
  * Recognition (~1953 - 1955)
  * Regulation (~1955 - present)
  * Removal of home incinerators (1957)
  * Industrial control
  * Automobile/gasoline regulation
    * Catalytic converters (1975 - present; federal requirement)
    * Filling shields
    * Fuel consumption
    * Fuel mileage
  * Sources of early Los Angeles smog:
    * The home incinerator
    * Oil refineries
    * Factories
    * The automobile
* Because of pollution, Southern California experienced an Ozone decrease after 1955.

### The Ozone Hole
* Ozone protects the Earth from ultraviolet rays from the sun.  However, it is an unstable molecule and can be broken down into oxygen gas very easily.
* One of the most common pollutants was CFC (cloro-floro-carbon), which was used in aerosols, refrigerants, and solvents.  A CFC molecule is lighter than air, so it floats up, and eventually, it will react with a Ozone molecule and create carbon monoxide and oxygen.
* Creation of carbon monoxide is also problematic because it reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that is often credited for causing global warming.
* Global temperatures have increased by 1 degree celsius since 1850, and it continues climbing.
