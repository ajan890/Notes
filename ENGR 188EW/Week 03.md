## Normative Ethics (continued)



* The branch of ethics that judges morality and tries to formulate normative recommendations about how to live or act.
* **Normative Judgment**
    * “Judgment about whether something is good or bad, desirable or undesirable, right or wrong”


### Vocabulary


#### Descriptive Ethics



* “The branch of ethics that describes existing morality, including customs and habits, opinions about good and evil, responsible and irresponsible behavior, and acceptable and unacceptable actions.”
* **Descriptive Judgment**
    * “A judgment that describes what is actually the case (the present), what was the case (the past), or what will be the case (the future)	


#### Values



* “Lasting convictions or matters that people feel shoudl be strived for in general and not just for themsleves to be able to lead a good life or to realize a just society”
    * **Intrinsic values:** an objective in and of itself
    * **Instrumental value:** a means to realize an intrinsic value


#### Norms



* “Rules that prescribe what actions are required, permitted, or forbidden.”
    * “Norms are the means by which to realize values.”


#### Virtues



* “A certain type of human characteristics or qualities:
    * They are desired characteristics and they express a value that is worth striving for.
    * They are expressed in action.
    * They are lasting and permanent - they form a lasting structural foundation for action.
    * They are always present, but are only used when necessary.
    * They can be influenced by the individual.”


#### Normative Relativism



* “An ethical theory that argues that all moral points of view - all values, norms, and virtues - are equally valid.”


#### Normative Ethical Theories



* Four types:
    * Utilitarianism
    * Deontology (“Duty ethics”)
        * Prima facie duties
    * Virtue ethics
        * Care ethics
    * Rights ethics
* The four normative ethical theories discussed here in class are NOT mutually exclusive - you can compare and contrast the same case within all four theories. Sometimes they are all in agreement, but in some cases three will be in agreement (pass or fail ethically) but utilitarianism becomes the odd man out.


### Utilitarianism



* Jeremy Bentham and John Steward Mill (late 18th - 19th century)
* Generally stated as “the greatest good for the greatest number of people.”
    * But, how do you define “good”?  Happiness, money, comfort, or ...?
* Utilitarianism seeks to judge an action by whether or not it gives the greatest good (or happiness, or money, or ...) to the greatest number of people.
* But how can we tell what constitutes the greatest good?  And how does one define the greatest number of people?  And most importantly, how about the moral responsibility to the losers in any action?
* Utilitarianism seems the **weakest** of the four normative ethical theories.


#### Risk-Benefit Analysis



* One recent (1970-) development of Utilitarianism is the creation of the scientific analytical method of risk-benefit analysis (and subsequently risk-cost-benefit analysis.
* These analytical techniques actually provide a more quantitative approach to Bentham’s Values (textbook, pages 82-83)
* Risk-benefit and risk-cost-benefit analyses provide a quantitative method for many governmental decisions, some good, some bad.  We will return to these issues later in the quarter.


#### Example - Keystone XL Pipeline



* The Keystone XL Pipeline is the latest version of a series of oil pipelines from Alberta to petroleum distribution points in the United States.
* Earlier Keystone pipelines extended from Alberta north of the Canadian/US border and then made a hard right turn to reach Steele City, Nebraska and existing pipelines.
* The Keystone XL would take a more direct route (the hypotenuse) and go essnetially straight from the Alberta oilfields to Steele city.
* The Keystone XL Pipeline oil is a heavy oil, more appropriately termed as a “tar sand” - that is, the viscosity is so high that removal from the ground is difficult.
    * The tar sand may be mined in the manner of coal, gravel, or iron ore.  Large seams of the tar sand may be dynamited to break up the rock, steam shovels load petroleum-bearing sands into trucks, which take the sands to a processing facility when high-temperature processing will make the tar more mobile and separatable from the sand matrix
    * Alternatively, steam may be injected at a high temperature and pressure to mobilize the tar, which is then pumped from a traditional well.
* Winners (_sensu_ Bentham/Mill):
    * 400000 direct or indirect Canadian jobs
    * Taxes to Alberta provincial government and Ottawa
    * Profits to Canadian and foreign investors 
    * Some short-term construction jobs in the United States as well as long-term US maintenance jobs
* Losers (_sensu _Bentham/Mill):
    * Canadian environment - millions of acres of boreal landscape irrevocably destroyed
    * Canadian environment - toxic (much of it carcinogenic) mining waste left behind
    * US risk to rivers that are crossed, including the Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers in Montana
    * Risk to the Sand Hills of Nebraska, a sensitive environmental area
    * Risk to the Ogalala aquifer, which provides drinking and agricultural water for much of Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado, Oklahoma, Kansas, and the Texas panhandle
    * Farmland destroyed by construction and long-term right-of-way in US
* So, what’s the greatest good for the greatest number of people when we consider the Keystone XL Pipeline?
    * Are there alternatives for transportation?
    * Is there really a need for this oil?
    * Could the tar sands crude be refined in Alberta and then transported as transportation fuels, etc. from within Alberta?


#### Example - Hetch Hetchy Valley



* In the late 1800s, as Yosemite Valley was designated first as a State Park and then a National Park (1890), attention soon turned to a nearly valley (then inside the National Park) that was almost a twin to Yosemite: The Hetch Hetchy Valley.
* San Francisco needed more water so they planned on building an aqueduct and a dam at Hetch Hetchy.
* Some things never change:
    * In the late 1950s and 1960s the US Bureau of Reclamation (the US government agency charged with building dams to supply water to the arid west) proposed three dams that would back water up into environmentally sensitive areas:
        * The Echo Canyon Dam in northwestern Colorado would destroy Dinosaur National Monument
        * The Marble Canyon Dam would slow the flow of water through the Grand Canyon to a trickle
        * The Bridge Canyon Dam would create a reservoir that would back up water into Grand Canyon National Park.


#### Example - The Owens Valley



* In the early 1900s the City of Los Angeles was looking for a new supply of water - and bought the majority of of the Owens Valley in eastern California
* Over the years, the City took the surface water in the southern Owens Valley, and then the northern Owens Valley, and shipped the water south.
* And then the City went after the groundwater, south and then north, and shipped it south.
* This caused part of the valley to become a desert
* Then the City moved north, buying key properties arouhnd Mono Lake, a unique, landlocked, saline, ecologically fragile body of water north of the Owens Valley.  The ongoing diversion of Mono Basin streams southward was draining Mono Lake to dangerously low levels.
* Finally, the Mono Lake Committee along with several other environmental organizations, filed suit against the city.  Represented _pro bono_ (for free) by the San Francisco law firm Morrison and Forester, the environmental groups prevailed.
* The City has been sued numerous times over the past century over its Owens Valley takings, but has never won an environmental case.


---



* Risk-Benefit Analysis:
    * We got water for the cities in California but we destroyed Mono Basin, most of Owens Valley, as well as the air quality in those areas.  It was very much at the benefit of the cities and the detriment of those living in the basins.


### Criticisms of Utilitarianism



* Happiness cannot be measured objectively
* Utilitarianism can lead to exploitation
* Consequences cannot be forseen objectively and often are unpredictable, unknown, or uncertain
* Distributive justice - an unjust distribution of costs and benefits
* Utilitarianism ignores personal relationships - who receives the “good” is irrelevant
* **Some actions are morally acceptable even if they do not create pleasure, and some actions that maximize pleasure are morally unacceptable.**


### Types of Arguments



* Deductive Argument - from the general to the particular
* Inductive argument - from the particular to the general


### Fallacies



* _Ad hominem_ argument (attack on the person rather than the argument)
* Confusion of law and ethics
    * “If it isn’t illegal, it is ethical”
* Straw person
    * An attempt is made to miss-state a person’s actual position and conclude that the original argument is a bad argument.  
    * The miss-stated argument often distorts the original argument.
* Wishful thinking
    * Facts are interpreted based on a person’s liking rather than actual evidence.
* Naturalistic fallacy
    * Deducing normative statements based only on descriptive statements.
    * “Stealing bikes is morally acceptable in the Netherlands because more bikes are stolen than bought in the Netherlands.”
* Privacy fallacy
    * “If you have done nothing wrong, you have nothing to worry about.”
* Ambiguity
    * Occurs when a word/phrase is used unclearly.
    * “The Captain was sober today” implies that the Captain is usaully drunk.  Or that he is sober every day.


### Fallacies of Risk



* Sheer size fallacy
    * X is accepted, and Y is a smaller risk than X.  Therefore, Y should be accepted.
* Fallacy of naturalness
    * X is unnatural, therefore it should not be accepted.
* The delay fallacy
    * If we wait we will know more about X.  Therefore we should not make a decision now.
* The technocratic fallacy
    * Whether X is dangerous is an engineering issue.  Therefore, the engineers should decide whether X is acceptable.
* The fallacy of pricing
    * We place “price tags” on the risk of X in order to measure and compare how bad it is.
* The ostrich’s fallacy
    * X does not give rise to any detectable risk or there is no scientific proof that X is dangerous.  So, X does not give rise to any unacceptable risk.


### Case Study - The DC-10 Aircraft


#### Paris



* The DC-10 was a passenger aircraft in 1974.
* During a flight, the freight door (to where luggage was stored) opened, and the fast loss of pressure in the cargo bay caused the floor of the passenger cabin to collapse.  The plane spiraled out of countrol and crashed, killing 346 people.
* The risk of this happening was known to some people before the event, but they did not fix it.
    * The reason they did not fix it was because there was a conflict between the supplier responsible for the door (Convair) and the plane manufacturer (Douglas).
    * Neither company wanted to adapt their design to the other’s, since it would weaken their legal positions
    * A memo was written by a Convair engineer explaining the shortcomings of the door, but it was ignored by management.


#### Failed Opportunities



1. Douglas failed to go beyond minimal FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) design regulations
2. Douglas fails to design for air pressure equilization - air vents and/or floor strength
3. Doublas and FAA ignore Dutch FAA input
4. Douglas forces electric door closer against Convair’s recommendations
5. Douglas censors FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis)
6. Douglas fails to fully responid to Long Beach blowout
7. Douglas ignores Riggs’ concerns about door design and redesign
8. Convair buries Applegate memorandum
9. Applegate does nothing more
10. Dutch FAA ignored again
11. Douglas does not respond in a timely or technically significant manner to fix door design
12. FAA does not force Douglas to fix door design in a timely manner
13. Unexplained QA/QC (quality assurance/quality control) inspection problems at Long Beach plant


#### Douglas’ Risk Calculations



* FAA Safety Standard is 1 x 10<sup>-9</sup> which means that for it to be considered safe, it must have a probability of 0.000000001 or less of happening.
* McDonnell Douglas’ Risk Calculations:
    * Loss of Engine due to any cause: 1 x 10<sup>-6</sup>
    * Risk of Asymmetric Slats: 1 x 10<sup>-5</sup>
    * Risk of Loss of Engine AND Asymmetric Slats: 1 x 10<sup>-6</sup> **x** 1 x 10<sup>-5</sup> = 1 x 10<sup>-11</sup>
    * (It is supposed to be OR, not AND, since it is no longer safe if either happen!)


#### DC-10 in Chicago



* Above the engine are three large bolts that attach the pylon and the engine to the wing.
* The outermost bolt, the AFT Bulkhead, broke while in midair, violently tearing the engine off the wing.
* The plane crashed into the ground, killing 273 people


#### Japan Airlines Flight 123



* The airplane was a Boeing 747 SR that was designed specifically for short-distance flights.  It had tougher landing gear and cabin in order to sustain more take-offs, landings, and pressurization cycles.
* During the end of a flight, a pilot landed the aircraft incorrectly and resulted in the tail of the airplane hitting the ground and severely damaging the aft fuselage skin, aft pressure bulkhead, and many other parts.  Although people were injured, there were no fatalities.
* Engineers decided they had to replace a large section of the bulkhead, which was subsequently manufactured.  It was supposed to be riveted onto the aircraft with two rows of rivets.  However, during installation, they found that the bulkhead was slightly too small, so instead of making a new one, they decided to insert a splice plate, a metal plate that was supposed to be riveted to the new plate and the existing plate - similar to a metal band-aid.  However, during installation, the splice plate was not large enough to have all three rows of rivets going through it, and as a result it only had two - one to the new plate and one to the existing plate.
* This connection failed during the next flight, and the airplane crashed into a mountain, killing 520 / 524 people onboard.


#### Sioux City



* Another DC-10 plane
* While flying, the right engine was torn apart along with the hydrolics used to control the plane.
* The pilots attempted an emergency landing while only being able to turn right (by changing the power of the left engine)
* The landing was nearly successful but the right wing hits the ground and breaks off, while the cabin of the aircraft begins tumbling across the runway.
* The nose of the plane was intact, the first class cabin was mostly disintegrated, as well as the parts behind the wing.
* The flight crew in the cockpit, and some passengers between rows 9 and 20, as well as some near the tail survive, with a few lucky ones walking out unharmed.


#### Paris: Preventable



* Dutch RLD 1968 concerns Ignored
* Convair concerns regarding electrical actuators ignored
* Douglas suppresses FMEA conclusions regarding cargo door fragility
* Implications of Long Beach blowout ignored
* Rigg’s concerns ignored
* Windsor incident implications ignored except for “band-aid” repairs
* Applegate memorandum buried
* Dutch RLD 1972 concerns ignored
* QA/QC problems at Long Beach Plant
* Douglas support of Turkish Airlines
* Douglas receives >100 reports of cargo door problems from airlines, does not act on information, and stonewalls FAA when information requested.


#### Chicago: Preventable



* Slat locks not installed
* Hydraulic lines placed in front of wing spar
* Miscalculation of loss of engine and asymmetric slats
* Unauthorized repair process ignored
* Wing spar repair kits sent out without asking “Why?”
* Airlines generally chose not to acquire redundant electrical source for stick shaker


#### Sioux City: Preventable



* McDonnell Douglas used only 3 hydraulic lines
* Lockhead installs hydraulic line shut-off valves; McDonnell Douglas does not
* Boeing adds hydraulic line shut-off valuve after JAL crash in 1985; McDonnell Douglas does not
* McDonnell Douglas miscalculates dispersion pattern of disintegrating engine fan

**After these accidents, DC-10 planes were permanently grounded.**


### Boeing 737 Max - A Troubled History



* Original Design: not the size and shape of the engines:

* As the 737 evolved, the engine size grew, and migrated to a position in front of the wing
* In the 737-700, the engine size had grown so much that the designers had to square off the engine cowling
* With the 737 MAX, engine diameter had grown to 6 ft, requiring reposition well in front of the wing
* Ultimately, the failure of the Boeing 737 MAX was due to managerial failure, of turning a long-standing engineering firm (the old Boeing) into just another bottom-line oriented Fortune 500 company
