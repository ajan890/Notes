# Week 1
## Why Engineering Ethics?
* Space Shuttle Challenger 1986
* Space Shuttle Columbia 2003
* UBER Autonomous Vehicle 2018
* Boeing 737 MAX Crash Ethiopia 2018
* Theranos 2004-2018
* Who is responsible for these accidents?

## Engineering and Teamwork
* In teams, we make amazing innovations and discoveries:
  * Electronic devices
  * Archeological excavations
  * Moon landing
  * etc.
#### Engineering as a Team Sport
* Teams compete
* Acquisition of contracts and projects
* Internal resources - funding and personnel
* Product marketing and sales

#### Teams are Rewarded and Penalized
* Some win, some lose
* Rewards of winning are real and substantial
* Employment and salary
* Career path and contributions
* Losing is not disastrous, but generally less beneficial
* Winning or losing depends on:
  * **Taskwork skills:** Technical capabilities
  * **Teamwork skills:** A variety of social factors
  
#### Engineering is Fundamentally Social
* Engineering has broad relationships with society:
  * Business
  * Welfare
  * Infrastructure
  * Public Works
  * Information
  * Communication
  * Entertainment
  * Art
* Engineering is a People-Centered Technology
  * Externally in its response to critical societal needs and constraints
  * Internally in the social dimensions of engineering team processes

#### Top Executives Depend on Social Skills
* Top-level executives competencies according to 300 high technology companies:
* Essential Skills:
  * Communication - 84%
  * Organizational - 75%
  * Team Building - 72%
  * Leadership - 68%
  * Coping 59%
  * Technological - 46%
* [Lawrence F. Bennett, *The Management of Engineering: Human, Quality, Organizational, Legal, and Ethical Aspects of Professional Practice*: New York, John Wiley & Sons, 1996]

#### Project Managers Need Social Skills as Well
