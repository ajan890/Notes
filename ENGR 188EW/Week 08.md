# Week 8
## The Ethics of Computing
### Patents
* Atanasoff – Berry Computer
  * Iowa State College (Ames) 1937-1942
  * First attempt at an electronic digital computing machine
    * Binary arithmetic
    * Analog-digital input
    * Digital – analog output
    * Simple memory
    * Simple programming
    * A special purpose computer
    
---

* Atanasoff and Berry go off to war work in Washington
* Mauchly stays in Philadelphia, working on ENIAC, generally considered to be the first general purpose electronic computer
* Immediately after the war, Mauchly files patents ( with J. Presper Eckert) on key ENIAC components, even though many of the key concepts were Atanasoff’s.
* Mauchly sells out to Sperry Rand, who begins developing computers on its own, and licensing rights to other firms, such as IBM and Honeywell.
* Honeywell finds out about Atanasoff’s early work that is evident in Mauchly’s patents.
* Honeywell sues Sperry Rand in 1967, and in 1973 a federal judge in Minneapolis invalidated the Mauchly patents.<br>

  > “Eckert and Mauchly did not themselves first invent the automatic electronic digital computer, but instead derived that subject matter from one Dr. John Vincent Atanasoff.”<br>
    * U. S. District Court Judge Earl R. Larson

### Hacking
* Most hacking seems to be done by malicious individuals, not necessarily computer scientists. But why can’t the university-trained computer scientists among us provide better security around out computer systems?

### Privacy
* Personal privacy seems to be secondary in the developing of large computer systems. Government, industrial, banking, an educational, have all been compromised.
* Often, there seems to be a lack of any privacy-protecting design in the development of large data bases.
* *Quo vadis*?

### Risk and Reliability
* Therac-25
* Boeing 737-MAX
* Computing allows for more rebust risk calculations, especially in complex engineered systems such as power plants, large industrial installations, etc.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
* Facial Recognition
* Criminal Bail Calculations
* Autonomous Vehicles

#### Examples
* **Facial Recognition Arrests**
* This gentleman was arrested by the Detroit police based on a facial recognition hit and held for 24 hr until his alibi could be verified.
* Previous to his arrest, the District Attorney had notified the police he would not file criminal charges based on facial recognition identification.<br>

* **Facial Recognition in China**

* Do we want this level of surveillance in the United States?

#### Case Study: UBER Autonomous Vehicle Crash
* In 2018, a Volvo fitted with UBER’s Automatic Driving System (ADS) hit a woman walking her bicycle across the road.
* The test driver was playing with her cellphone at the time, and thus ignored the warnings from the ADS system. <br>
  > “At the time when the ADS detected the pedestrian for the first time, 5.6 seconds before impact, she was positioned approximately in the middle of the two left turn lanes ... Although the ADS sensed the pedestrian nearly 6 seconds before the impact, the system never classified her as a pedestrian—or predicted correctly her goal as a jaywalking pedestrian or a cyclist—because she was crossing the N. Mill Avenue at a location without a crosswalk; **the system design did not include a consideration for jaywalking pedestrians.** Instead, the system had initially classified her as an other object which are not assigned goals. As the ADS changed the classification of the pedestrian several times—alternating between vehicle, bicycle, and an other— the system was unable to correctly predict the path of the detected object.”<br> 

  > "Only when the ADS determined that the object’s currently detected location was on the path of the ATG vehicle—1.2 seconds before impact—the system recognized an emergency situation, an imminent collision. At that time, because preventing the collision would have required extreme braking or steering actions—beyond the design specifications—the ADS initiated suppression of its motion plan. One second later, the vehicle was still on the collision path with the pedestrian, and preventing the collision still required an extreme avoidance maneuverer; per design, the system did not engage emergency brakes, but rather provided an auditory alert to the vehicle operator as it initiated a plan for the vehicle slowdown.” <br>

* Can UBER's Automated Driving System understand that it's Grizzly 399 and her four cubs that have just bounded onto the road in Wyoming?<br>

* Or can UBER's detection systems identify 399 and her cubs as they wander through downtown Jackson in the evening?<br>

* Or a four-year-old running into the street, since he's not in a crosswalk?<br>

### Other Issues in Computing
* Whistle Blowing
* Use in education – digital divide
* Use in warfare – autonomous drones
* Effect of e-commerce on Main Street
* Open racial and religious discrimination

#### Voting Technology
* Since the 2000 General Election, voting machines have been the subject of constant complaints. Early attempts at automated vote counting we based on punch cards, later evolving to “mark-sense” cards. Early electronic voting machines were plagued with machine interface problems, but by the 2020 election virtually all complaints against machine counts were unfounded, since the ability to count the paper ballots was a back up.
* Prior to about 1970, much of the United States used large paper ballots – mark your choice with an “X” – with the ballots counted in the precinct.
* An alternative – especially along the east coast – was the mechanical voting machine. Unfortunately, it left no paper trail and was thus subject to political manipulation.
* Beginning in the 1970s, many jurisdictions began using punch cards – Hollerith or IBM cards – with the voter punching out their choice.
  * **Aside: IBM Cards**
    * The voting cards could be sorted by an electronic sorter.
    * But on the day before the 1988 General Election, Ronnie Dugger, in the New Yorker, published a piece questioning the accuracy of punch-card voting.
    * Dugger’s predictions came true during the 2000 General Election, especially in Florida.
    * After the debacle in Florida, many jurisdictions switched to mark-sense voting – essentially a Scantron type card. In California, we kept mark-sense through the 2016 election in many cases.
* Some jurisdictions adopted early models of electronic voting machines, but many models had severe problems, especially those by Diebold – the cash register company.
* Electronic voting machines have evolved significantly over the last 20 years. There have been growing pains, but today’s machines seem accurate and reliable, especially since virtually all of them involve a physical paper trail.
* **The Future?**
  * Computer?
  * Cell phone?
  * All-absentee voting?
