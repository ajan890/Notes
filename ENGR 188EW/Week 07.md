### Case Study - Kansas City Hyatt-Regency
* The Kansas City Hyatt Regency was a large hotel development in downtown Kansas City, Missouri
* The original plan included a large atrium with three walkways leading from the hotel tower to the meeting room block - by using the walkways a person could avoid having to go all the way to the lobby and then back up.  The walkways would be suspended from the roof of the atrium on long 1.25 inch diameter rods. Because the use of the long rods was unworkable, the steel fabricator suggested switching to shorter rods.
  * Instead of one rod holding all the platforms from the ceiling, each rod only spans one floor; each platform was attached to the platform above it.
* Consider the structural load on each of the bolts that connect the walkways to the rods.  In the original plan, each bolt would carry 1P load.  (1 platform)
* However, on the revised plan, the bolts that hold up the walkway also have to carry the load of the walkways below.  Therefore, two walkways would require the upper walkway to carry a 2P load.  (2 platforms)<br>

* During an evening dance, the 4th floor walkway tore loose, and both the 2nd and 4th floor walkways collapsed onto the lobby floor below.
#### Discussion of the actions of the engineering firm involved
* Overcommitted work load
* Incompetence from day one
* Failure to analyze fabricator's suggested change
* Signing and sealing new plans without evaluation
### Case Study - I-35 Bridge Collapse, Minneapolis
* Gusset plates are those large sheets of riveted metal that attach steel members to one another.  For some inexplicable reason, a number of the gusset plates were underdesigned.<br>

* Demand to capacity calculations show that some of the gusset plates were under designed.<br>

* New construction in the mid-1960s created the I-35 bridge.  Dead weight was about 25 million pounds, with live weight (automobiles and people) estimated at about 1.5 million pounds
* In 1977, the State began some resurfacing of the bridge surface, and resurfacing with 3 inches of new concrete.  This resurfacing weighed about 3 million pounds of concrete, or about 13.1 percent added dead weight.
* In 1998, construction on the bridge upgraded the concrete median and the concrete railings, and the installation of an anti-icing system.  This work weighed about 1.13 million pounds or about 6.1 percent to the dead weight of the bridge.
* Finally, in 2007 the resurfacing in progress added about 1.16 million pounds (6.25%) to the dead weight of the bridge.  At the time of collapse, this was mainly the construction materials (sand, concrete aggregate, etc.) and the construction vehicles.
* Taken together, the three construction jobs added about 5.4 million pounds (or 25%) to the dead weight of the bridge.
* The original bridge was only designed for about 26.5 million pounds of dead weight + live weight.
* Not once, not during the 1977, 1998, or 2007 work, did anyone in the structural engineering firm, the Minnesota Department of Transportation, or the Federal Highway Administration walk down to the plan room and pull the blueprints and calculation sheets.
### Case Study - Grenfell Tower (London)
* The Grenfell Tower was a high rise, affordable-rent, apartment complex in London originally built in 1967.
* In 2015-16 it underwent an upgrade which included exterior cladding for insulaiton purposes.
* In 2017, a fire broke out in one of the flats, and rapidly spread upward, the exterior cladding serving as the route by which the fire spread.
* Cladding included material that could burn under high termperature, and the air gap behind the cladding acted as a chimney, allowing the fire to spread upward until the entire building was consumed.
* This type of cladding was not allowed in the United States.<br>

### Case Study - Florida International University Pedestrian Bridge
* A 175 ft foot bridge at Florida International University collapsed onto the street immediately after installation due to engineering miscalculations.<br>

### Case Study - Surfside Condominium, Florida (2021)
* One section collapses in about 20 seconds
* Possible causes (still under NIST investigation) include poor construction, poor construction supervision and inspection, and deferred maintenance that affected the structural members at the base of the tower<br>

### Case Study - Cypress Viaduct, Oakland
* The Cypress viaduct was a 1.8 mile double-decked freeway segment attaching the southern extension of Interstate 880 through Oakland to the eastern terminus of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.  It was the first double decked freeway in California.
* In the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the viaduct mancaked due to the non-existent connections between the bents, exacerbated by the fact that the viaduct was built on non-stable ground (fill).<br>

* Note that the upper segment sits directly on top of the lower segment, without any formal connections.<br>

### Just War Theory
* From antiquity - developed by St. Augustine (4th Century) and Thomas Aquinas (13th Century)
#### Jus ad bellum:
"The conditions under which States may resort to war or to the use of armed force in general."
* Just Cause
  * War should be used to re-establish peace, rather than to pursue interests.
* Comparative justice
  * Asks whether values, rights, and justice would justify killing
* Competent authority
  * Asks whether the government or official wanting to start the war is competent to do so
* Right intention
  * If war is justified for one reason, then it should not be fought for another unjustified reason.
* Probability of success
  * One cannot start a war if there's no chance of winning.
* Last resort
  * All non-violent options must be exhausted before war
* Proportionality
  * The cause of war must be of sufficient importance to justify war to defend it.
#### Jus in bello:
* Distinction
  * Regulates the conduct of parties engaged in an armed conflict
* Proportionality
  * A relation between the harm that military action would cause to innocent civilians and the harm that it would prevent the combatants who inflict it from suffering
* Military necessity
  * One is entitled to do whatever is necessary to ensure victory for one's own side
* Fair treatment of prisoners of war
* No <em>means malum in se</em>
  * No motivations or means that is wrong in itself
### Discussions
* The use of drones in the military (and civilian society)
* The Bomb (nuclear warfare)
