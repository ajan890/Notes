## Longshan Culture
* Mountaneous region on a peninsula in north-east China (below modern-day North Korea)
* Characteristic black pottery
  * Requires hotter firing temperatures to make compared to Yangshao pots
  * Considered as a luxury item
* "Interacting Complex Chiefdoms"
  * Basically a city-state, but there is no writing yet.
  * Each city-state has some arms race with the others to prevent being invaded.
  * City-states have copper and bronze technology, as well as pipes and irrigation, and long-distance trade.
* It is been hypothesized that multiple modern-day Chinese dialects originated here.
* Taosi (centuries before and after 2000 BCE)
  * There was an observatory with a wall that is semi-circular facing a mountain to the east.  There is a semi-circular wall with notches that correspond to the sun's position and the mountain's shadow.
  * Modern-day Shanxi region
  * Like Shimao (another state slightly to the north), built large, heavily fortified cities
  * Very stratified in social rank
  * Much was built to made of rammed earth (made of Loess soil), not stone.
    * Some of these rammed earth structures remain today.
  * Was destroyed once in war
    * The city actually grew much larger when they rebuilt after the war.  (Final size: ~300 hectares)
## Erlitou Culture (2070-1600 BCE)
* Culture in Xia dynasty
* In city-states, if the nobles are overthrown, the nobles can move to a different city state they are friends with, move into the palace there, and continue ruling.
* Large trade hub in the east
* Focused on economics, and was taken over by different governing powers multiple times
* Luxury Items:
  * Erlitou people started using turquoise
  * Some weapons, etc. were decorated using jade or turquoise, and used as luxury or symbolic items, rather than for battle
  * Erlitou mastered the use of bronze 
    * Had logistical systems for transporting ore and processing it
    * Probably found copper and zinc ores
    * Bronze was mostly *casted* in China, unlike the western civilizations which usually pounded it in a forge.
    * Molds were made using clay models for bronze casting.  This allowed for mass production since molds could be reused.
  * Ritual item: *ding*, a cauldron which when used for cooking, also passes its contents to the ancestors.  Allowed people to symbolically cook feasts for the dead.
* Due to bronze mastery and weapon production, it is hypothesized the Erlitou dominated in military.

## Shang Dynasty (1600-1045 BCE)
* Shang had a massive area of influence (about a quarter of modern-day China), although the area it controlled was only a fraction of that
* Shimao
  * Shang dynasty city with massive fortifications
  * There were jade disks stuffed into the cracks of the walls
* "Coerced cooperation"
  * People are able to unite under the Shang empire because they were forced to probably to not starve or get killed
  * This allows the Shang to grow to a very large size
* Shang lasted for ~500 years before Zhou overthrew it.
## Zhou Dynasty (1045-256 BCE)
* There exist manuscripts describing the sky when the Zhou dynasty was founded.
* They record "heavenly omens" that the Shang dynasty was falling and the Zhou dynasty was beginning
* Astronomy
  * Modern-day scholars use software to predict what the sky looked like in the past and estiamte that the Zhou started at around ~1045 BCE.
* Zhou's excuse for overthrowing the Shang dynasty was that the heavens had seen the virtues of King Wen and King Wu of the Zhou, and transferred the *mandate of heaven* to Zhou from the Shang.
  * It is not easy to overthrow a party that has been ruling for 500+ years.
* The first move that Zhou did was to put their family into the government structure.
  * e.g., defeat existing Shang dynasty local rulers, or force them to surrender, etc.
* "court policies"
  * Chinese politics (and even family) are very hierarchical.
  * However, since government is an expansion of family relations, people in the same hierarchical tier in the family can be in competition over government positions
  * Siblings (especially brothers) would literally kill each other to get ahead in the pursuit of government positions or become the hier of the dynasty.
  * Basically feudalism
  * Government is patrimonial (positions and assets are inherited by eldest male)
* Western Zhou eventually fell to raiders
  * There was so much wealth and power involved that commoners broke into the property and "rebalanced" the wealth.
