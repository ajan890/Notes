## Longshan Culture
* Mountaneous region on a peninsula in north-east China (below modern-day North Korea)
* Characteristic black pottery
  * Requires hotter firing temperatures to make compared to Yangshao pots
  * Considered as a luxury item
* "Interacting Complex Chiefdoms"
  * Basically a city-state, but there is no writing yet.
  * Each city-state has some arms race with the others to prevent being invaded.
  * City-states have copper and bronze technology, as well as pipes and irrigation, and long-distance trade.
* It is been hypothesized that multiple modern-day Chinese dialects originated here.
* Taosi (centuries before and after 2000 BCE)
  * There was an observatory with a wall that is semi-circular facing a mountain to the east.  There is a semi-circular wall with notches that correspond to the sun's position and the mountain's shadow.
  * Modern-day Shanxi region
  * Like Shimao (another state slightly to the north), built large, heavily fortified cities
  * Very stratified in social rank
  * Much was built to made of rammed earth (made of Loess soil), not stone.
    * Some of these rammed earth structures remain today.
  * Was destroyed once in war
    * The city actually grew much larger when they rebuilt after the war.  (Final size: ~300 hectares)
## Erlitou Culture (2070-1600 BCE)
* Culture in Xia dynasty
* In city-states, if the nobles are overthrown, the nobles can move to a different city state they are friends with, move into the palace there, and continue ruling.
* Large trade hub in the east
* Focused on economics, and was taken over by different governing powers multiple times
* Luxury Items:
  * Erlitou people started using turquoise
  * Some weapons, etc. were decorated using jade or turquoise, and used as luxury or symbolic items, rather than for battle
  * Erlitou mastered the use of bronze 
    * Had logistical systems for transporting ore and processing it
    * Probably found copper and zinc ores
    * Bronze was mostly *casted* in China, unlike the western civilizations which usually pounded it in a forge.
    * Molds were made using clay models for bronze casting.  This allowed for mass production since molds could be reused.
  * Ritual item: *ding*, a cauldron which when used for cooking, also passes its contents to the ancestors.  Allowed people to symbolically cook feasts for the dead.
* Due to bronze mastery and weapon production, it is hypothesized the Erlitou dominated in military.

## Shang Dynasty (1600-1045 BCE)
* Shang had a massive area of influence (about a quarter of modern-day China), although the area it controlled was only a fraction of that
*
