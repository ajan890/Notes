# State Competition in Early China: Eastern Zhou Civilization

* At this point, the western Zhou started losing power.  The Eastern Zhou still interacted with the west through trade, economy, etc., but people recognized that a new power was emerging.
* The Qin started at around this time (early 8th century BCE), and would eventually take over the entire region.
  * The Qin was an overlord (gained control through power, not heritage)
* The south (area near the Yangtze River) began gaining economic influence, due to their agriculture.

## Five "Confucian" Classics
* By the end of the Qin dynasty, there will be 13 classics.  The count changes over time.
* Classic of Poetry (Shijing)
  * A collection of ~300 poems
  * Includes poems of many topics - love, folk songs, war, etc.
* Classic of Documents (Shangchu)
  * Collection of speeches from early China
* Classic of Ritual (Li)
  * The Duke of Zhou's list of official appointments
  * "Ritual", as in, "how to run the government"
* Classic of Changes (Yijing)
  * Discussed the processes of divination - how to read them, what they mean, etc.
  * There are different "layers" of divination.
* Spring and Autumn Annals (Chunqiu)
  * Discussed events between 722-479 BC.
  * Contained annual historical records, newspaper headlines, etc.
  * Ended with Confucious' death
  * There are three commentaries.  When this book is referred to in modern day, it also includes the commentaries.
    * Two commentaries state that Confucius edited the book, in that he rewrote history.  (It was eventually proved that that wasn't the case.)
    * Zuozhuan (Zuo commentary or Zuo Tradition) (722-468, 453)
    * Gongyang commentary
    * Guliang commentary
* Classic of Music (Yue)
  * This is more of a "hidden" classic.

# Era of Warring States
* During this time, people moved around the states when they got in trouble.
* Other states are willing to take the "trouble people" for intel on other states and for thoughts on how to structure the military, government, etc.
* People with their ways of thinking sometimes had titles for their way of thinking:

## Six "schools" or "lineages" or "Masters"
1. *Ru* or "Confucianism"
    * Confucianism became very distinct during the warring states period although it existed long before
    * They argued that legalism was too strict because if laws are too clearly defined, then people will try to game the system.
2. Daoism
    * Two texts: *Laozi* and *Zhuangzi*
    * *Laozi*:
      * A serious text stating to live according to the nature of your position.
      * Go with the flow.
    * *Zhuangzi*:
      * Humorous book describing *the way* is present everwhere, "even in piss and shit".
      * Language is a "fish trap".  Once you catch the fish, throw the trap away.  Basically, don't limit your thinking by your language.
3. Legalism
    * Used in the Qin government
    * Reward vs. Punishment
    * Punishment tends to be harsh, and reward tends to be incremental (e.g., 5 heads from battle gets you this, 10 heads gets you this, etc.)
    * Laws are very clearly defined.
4. Mohism
    * Rose due to the criticism of the way society worked
    * For example, why would you bury the ruler with three coffins, when you could be spending the money on the people instead?
    * Counter-culture which challenged the mandate of heaven
    * Showed concern for everyone ("universal love")
5. School of Names
    * Grew out of Mohism
6. School of Naturalists

* These are different schools of thought about ethics and morality.
* After the Han dynasty took over Qin, they inherited many of the Legalist laws, but made it more gentle.
  * An area as large as China to control at that time may not be possible without the strong structure of laws.
  * Mohism pretty much died out during this time
  * At this point, legalism as a view seemed to become a social taboo; no one wanted to be labelled as a legalist.

### The Long Rise and Quick Fall of Qin
* During this time, the aristocrats are gaining more power than the rulers due to economic affairs.
* Local power was challenging more centralized power.
* At 221 BCE, Qin took over China and unifies the currency, roads, and metrics of measurement.  They were the first to establish logistics, technology, and documentation guidelines.
