# State Competition in Early China: Eastern Zhou Civilization

* At this point, the western Zhou started losing power.  The Eastern Zhou still interacted with the west through trade, economy, etc., but people recognized that a new power was emerging.
* The Qin started at around this time (early 8th century BCE), and would eventually take over the entire region.
  * The Qin was an overlord (gained control through power, not heritage)
* The south (area near the Yangtze River) began gaining economic influence, due to their agriculture.

## Five "Confucian" Classics
* By the end of the Qin dynasty, there will be 13 classics.  The count changes over time.
* Classic of Poetry (Shijing)
  * A collection of ~300 poems
  * Includes poems of many topics - love, folk songs, war, etc.
* Classic of Documents (Shangchu)
  * Collection of speeches from early China
* Classic of Ritual (Li)
  * The Duke of Zhou's list of official appointments
  * "Ritual", as in, "how to run the government"
* Classic of Changes (Yijing)
  * Discussed the processes of divination - how to read them, what they mean, etc.
  * There are different "layers" of divination.
* Spring and Autumn Annals (Chunqiu)
  * Discussed events between 722-479 BC.
  * Contained annual historical records, newspaper headlines, etc.
  * Ended with Confucious' death
  * There are three commentaries.  When this book is referred to in modern day, it also includes the commentaries.
    * Two commentaries state that Confucius edited the book, in that he rewrote history.  (It was eventually proved that that wasn't the case.)
    * Zuozhuan (Zuo commentary or Zuo Tradition) (722-468, 453)
    * Gongyang commentary
    * Guliang commentary
* Classic of Music (Yue)
  * This is more of a "hidden" classic.

# Era of Warring States
* During this time, people moved around the states when they got in trouble.
* Other states are willing to take the "trouble people" for intel on other states and for thoughts on how to structure the military, government, etc.
* People with their ways of thinking sometimes had titles for their way of thinking:

## Six "schools" or "lineages" or "Masters"
1. *Ru* or "Confucianism"
    * Confucianism became very distinct during the warring states period although it existed long before
    * They argued that legalism was too strict because if laws are too clearly defined, then people will try to game the system.
2. Daoism
    * Two texts: *Laozi* and *Zhuangzi*
    * *Laozi*:
      * A serious text stating to live according to the nature of your position.
      * Go with the flow.
    * *Zhuangzi*:
      * Humorous book describing *the way* is present everwhere, "even in piss and shit".
      * Language is a "fish trap".  Once you catch the fish, throw the trap away.  Basically, don't limit your thinking by your language.
3. Legalism
    * Used in the Qin government
    * Reward vs. Punishment
    * Punishment tends to be harsh, and reward tends to be incremental (e.g., 5 heads from battle gets you this, 10 heads gets you this, etc.)
    * Laws are very clearly defined.
4. Mohism
    * Rose due to the criticism of the way society worked
    * For example, why would you bury the ruler with three coffins, when you could be spending the money on the people instead?
    * Counter-culture which challenged the mandate of heaven
    * Showed concern for everyone ("universal love")
5. School of Names
    * Grew out of Mohism
6. School of Naturalists

* These are different schools of thought about ethics and morality.
* After the Han dynasty took over Qin, they inherited many of the Legalist laws, but made it more gentle.
  * An area as large as China to control at that time may not be possible without the strong structure of laws.
  * Mohism pretty much died out during this time
  * At this point, legalism as a view seemed to become a social taboo; no one wanted to be labelled as a legalist.

### The Long Rise and Quick Fall of Qin
* During this time, the aristocrats are gaining more power than the rulers due to economic affairs.
* Local power was challenging more centralized power.
* At 221 BCE, Qin took over China and unifies the currency, roads, and metrics of measurement.  They were the first to establish logistics, technology, and documentation guidelines.
* Once Qin Shi Huang died, and his son succeeded, there was an over-concentration of power.
  * Qin Shi Huang was a genius in terms of management who was very capable of running the government.   Supposedly he would have a "quota" of the number of documents he would read per day, and would not sleep until it were complete.
  * His son does not have the same work ethic nor experience, and a rebellion occurred.

# Han Dynasty (202 BCE - 220 CE)
## Western Han (Former Han, 202 BCE - 9 CE)
* Han took over Qin.  Liu Bang became the emperor.
* Han enjoyed some temporary peace.
* Han rejected legalism, but were unable to wipe it out completely since Qin had its influence and they could not do a complete reform.
* After Liu Bang passed away, his son was supposed to take over, but instead, his wife did, known as Empress Lu.
  * The Empress was particularly harsh with the way things worked, basically torturing anyone who did not agree with her on political matters.
  * The Empress also attempted to give her lineage access to imperial power, which was strictly forbidden in the Chinese dynastic cycle, since the Liu family was supposed to inherit the throne.
  * The empress was eventually overthrown.
* This was the end of passing power through lineage.
## Xin (Wang Mang reign, 9 - 23 CE)
[FILL]

## Eastern Han (aka. Later Han, 25-220)
* Cao Cao takes over Han dynasty; after he dies, his elder son Cao Pi becomes the new emperor; this is the end of the Han dynasty and the start of the Wei dynasty.
* Buddhism spreads into China at around this time.

# The Six Dynasties (220 - 589)
## The Three Kingdoms (220 - 280)
## Jin Dynasty (265 - 420)
* At some time in the 4th century, a particularly cold winter occurred, and the yangze river had a breach.
* The Western Jin collapses due to taxation from powers from the North.  This is the first time where a foreign power (Mongols) are controlling Chinese land.
* In (317-420), the Eastern Jin rebuilt the southern Jin area, taking names, ways of thinking, etc. from the North and implanting them in the south.
  * During this time, a lot of migration occurred.
## Northern and Southern Dynasties (420 - 589)
