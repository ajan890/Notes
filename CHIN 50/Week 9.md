  * Said that the scholars of the Late Qing hijacked Confucius' thought, and argued that Confucius was actually a reformist
  * During these hundred days, he gained a lot of support to make reforms based on the old Chinese ways, but also had a lot of opposition
* **Empress Dowager Cixi** (1835-1908): The major power in China during the time; was denounced by Kang Youwei.
  * Against Kang Youwei's reforms
  * Puts an end to the reforms after 100 days (hence the name)

#### Boxer Rebellion (1900)
* Men from dispossessed peasant families (the "bare sticks" mentioned previously) made up the most involved in the Boxer Rebellion
* Many of the people believed they were immune to bullets.  (Lack of education, suspicion of Christian missionaries, suspicion of new technology, etc.)
* Caused by Christian missionaries being so full of themselves believing what they are doing is correct, and pissing off Chinese people
* Empress Dowager supported the Boxers because she believed that they had a chance of defeating the Westerners.  (Meanwhile, a lot of the high-ranking Chinese military generals, like Yuan Shikai (1859-1916), were opposed to it)
* The rebellion ended by the Western countries sending the military and defeating the Boxers.  China was forced to pay another large indemnity.
#### New Policies (1901-1908)

    2. Democracy: Establishing a government led by the people, inspired by Western tradition
    3. People's Livelihood: Promoting social welfare, land reform, equitable economic development

#### ASIDE: World War II
* People like Jack London took on a very racist approach against Asian people because Westerners were scared of the Chinese and Japanese rising up.  (The term "Yellow Fever" originates here.)
* Thinkers in Japan believed they were the "leaders of Asia", and that other Asian countries needed their "benelovent conquest", and proceeded to invade and colonize Asia.
  * WWII for them, was essentially their personal invasion of China - millions of deaths, and lots of war crimes.
    * War crimes involved torturing captured soldiers and civilians, raping and killing women, looting, mass executions, burning down cities, bombed civilians, mass starvings.  (Raping of Nanking)
    * The United States, disgusted by this behavior, ended it with two atomic bombs.
