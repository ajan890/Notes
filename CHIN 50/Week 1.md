# Introduction

## "Chinese"
From "The Living Tree", by Tu Wei-ming
* People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan
* overseas Chinese communities
* international communities of scholars, journalists, and other interested observers
* One does not necessarily need to be of Chinese ethnicity to be Chinese

## "Civilization"
**"Civil"**
* "relating to civil law or life; pertaining to the internal affairs of a state" (late 14th century)
* "not barbarous, civilized" (1550s)
* "relating to the commonwealth as secularly organized" (as opposed to *military* or *ecclesiastical*) by 1610s

**"-ize"**
* this suffix means "to change"
* Note the definition of "civilization" also changes over time.

One main idea covered throughout the course is that civilization always comes at a cost.  Essentially, someone must lose.
  * Someone was displaced to build UCLA on its current campus grounds
  * Someone had to have been displaced for the development of any country or government
  * etc.

## Culture
* Most people in the past 5000 years spent their lives tilling the ground and growing crops
* "Culture is a concept that encompasses the social behavior, institutions, and norms found in human societies, as well as the knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities, and habits of the individuals in these groups." - Wikipedia
* Culture includes many parts: Tradition, legacy, heritage, and birthright
* 文 ("Wen"): pattern, order, writing, culture
  * Can be represented by the stereotypical confucious person of following social rules of respect
* 文化: "Culture", "transformation by *wen*"
* 文明: "Civilization", "the brightness of *wen*"

## Proposed features of "Chinese Civilization"
Paul R. Goldin (2018): "seven basic features of Chinese civilization that endured despite regional diversity and historical change":

1. Ancestor worship and respect for elders, especially parents;
2. the use of written Chinese as a *[FILL]*
3. belief in the superiority of Chinese culture and the wisdom of Sinicizing foreigners;
4. a lack of any native tradition of democracy;
5. a preference for civil over military methods of control;
6. openness to religious diversity combined with intolerance of autonomous religious authority on the part of the imperial government;
7. an imbalanced sex ratio exacerbated by polygyny among the elite, resulting in a large and restive population of unmarried males

## Geographical Overview

### Yellow River
The Loess Plateau is the area between the Yellow River and the Gobi Desert.  
* It is composed of Loess soil (silt-like soil) blown in from the deserts from the west and north.
* This type of soil was used for agriculture (think: terraced landforms), specifically, growing millet.
* The Yellow River is yellow also because of the Loess soil present in the water.

This is significant because this is where agriculture started in China.  This area supported permanent settlements, unlike the people of the steppe (nomadic "tribes"), which were present to the north and west.
  * The Mongols were considered "steppe people", and were early enemies of China.

### Yangzi River
* The Yangzi River (長江) is south of the Yellow River, and is present in an area of Chinese that receives considerably more precipitation than the Yellow River.
* This river does not carry silt.
* This river acts as a dividing line between North and South China.
* This river supported a lot of trade, knowledge propagation, communication, and even warfare.

## The Dynastic Cycle
* The Chinese were not always unified, rather, there are many smaller groups.  When one of the groups grows large enough and has enough power, it begins to declare its own laws.  (The group gains an emperor).  Sometimes, when territory is contested, one would overthrow another.
  * The Mongols were one of the such groups.  They used to control a very large area, but then lost power over time.
  * People of this time were aware of the dynastic cycle; emperors would train future emperors to take their stead to keep their reign going.
