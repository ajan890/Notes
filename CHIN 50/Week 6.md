## Soutern Song Dynasty (1127-1279)
**Zhu Xi** (1130-1200)
* His life goal was to create a new branch of Confucianism suited for his times.
* He designated the Four Books for the civil service exam to take the place of the Five Classics people were tested on before:
  * "Analects"
  * "Mencius"
  * "The Great Learning"
  * "Doctrine of the Mean"

## Mongol Dynasties
* The following three dynasties were during the time where the Northern Song dynasty was forced to yield to northern invaders.  These dynasties were ruled by mongols, not the Chinese.
* It is worth noting that each dynasty here learns from the past dynasties' mistakes, until they are able to take over the entirety of China (eliminating the Southern Song) and unify China again.
### Khitan Liao (907-1125)
* These people originated from Eastern Mongolia
* They set their capital in the current site of Beijing
* The Khitan set up their own writing script, which looks very similar to Chinese but all the characters are a bit different.
* When they began their ruling, they did not change any rules; they preserved the Chinese "protocol" of ruling the regions.  There was only a change in power.
  * They ran the Liao Dynasty.
### Tangut Xi Xia (1038-1227)
* This dynasty existed for some time to the west of the Khitan Liao dynasty, in the North China plain.
* The Song dynasty was essentially landlocked by the Tangut Xi Xia and the Khitan Liao, and therefore the Song was taxed heavily for trade on the silk road.
* This dynasty did not exist for very long; they were taken over by the Jin dynasty.

### Jurchen Jin (1115-1234)
* The Jurchen Jin originated to the north of the Liao, and managed to forge an alliance with the Southern Song dynasty.
* This was a dynasty during which a lot of war occurred.  They were fighting the Liao, Southern Song, and the Mongols.
  * This was the first dynasty using firearms en mass.  e.g., reloadable/reusable cannons and handheld firearms were being used.
* They eventually took over Liao and controlled the entire North China.
* Jurchen Jin also created its own script, using the Khitan script as a basis.
* The Jurchens moved their capital to Kaifeng, which is close to Luoyang: very central to China.

**Yue Fei** (1103-1142)
* Was a patriot and a loyalist of the Song dynasty.
* He was one of those people who would disobey his superiors and continue fighting to the death.
* He was a general in the war between Song and Jurchen Jin.
* He was supposedly put to death by the Southern Song after being framed for war crimes.  (This story differs between sources).

#### A Note on Ethnicity
* In modern day, China still refers to its largest Ethnic group as the Han.
* This obviously ties back to the Han dynasty, but was present really to distinguish those not from China (e.g., the Jurchens, Mongols, etc.)
* During Jurchen ruling, it was likely that the term "Han" was referred to as "lowly peasants".

### Mongols
#### Chinggis (Genghis) Khan (1162-1227)
* A very famous warlord and government official who rose to power with the Mongols.
  * He united the many groups of Mongols and centralized the government; instead of having each group listen to its tribal leader, he conquered them all and put together an army.
* His early life and rise is documented well in multiple books (search them up).
* Khan was involved in many wars between 1213-1215, located all across Asia, stretching as far West as modern-day Ukraine and Eastern Europe.
* He defeated the Jurchen Jin dynasty in 1234 and started controlling Northern China.  (The Southern Song still existed at this point)
* The Southern Song was eventually taken over (in 1279) by his grandson, Khubilai Khan (r. 1260-1294).
* Since the land the Mongols ruled was so vast, it fragmented once Genghis Khan passed away (presumably due to lack of communication).

#### Yelu Chucai (1190-1244)
* A stateman who was active in ruling the early Mongol empire
* He was one of Genghis Khan's retainers who set up policy during the Mongol invasions and conquests.
* He was originally from the Khitan Liao dynasty before it was taken over.

#### Silk
* One of the technologies (surprisingly) that allowed the Mongols to make their conquest was silk.
* The mongol warriors were wearing silk "undershirts" under their leather armor.  A typical infantry warrior would carry a sword, a bow, and a quiver of about 20 arrows.  A typical calvalry warrior would carry a lance, a bow, and a quiver of about 20 arrows.
  * Compared to those from the West who were wearing full body iron armor, the mongol warriors were very lightweight, and therefore can last longer before exhaustion.
  * Additionally, the silk was so tightly woven that if arrows made it through the leather armor, they could be stopped by the silk.  If actually pierced, the silk bends around the wound, acting like skin, which stops bleeding and allows the body to heal.
  * Compared to iron armor, once it is broken or pierced, it does not protect the body in that area at all, and a piercing arrow can still be lethal since the iron armor won't stop bleeding.

#### Culture
* The Mongols created their own script.  Structurally, it is similar to Korean (although it looks completely differnet), where glyphs acted as letters and gave hint to the pronunciation.
  * The Mongols, unlike previous dynasties, were not interested in becoming a part in Chinese culture.  Instead, they attempted to create a parallel system.  (e.g., to get into their government, you had to take *their* civil service exam, which was about the Mongols instead of China)
* The Mongols were relatively laissez-faire when it came to regulating trade.  They didn't mind what people did as long as they agreed to be subjects to the Mongol government.
* Despite this, the Mongols had very strong social control; they attempted to do heriditary inheritance of jobs; your children are forced into whatever job you have.
* Mongols created their own versions of Daoism and Buddhism

#### People
* Marco Polo (c. 1254-1324) travelled to China during the Mongol rule, and was given multiple government positions after he impressed Khubilai Khan with his linguistic and diplomatic skills.

# Ming Dynasty
### Red Turban Movement
* The Red Turban Movement was an uprising of peasants that overthrew the Yuan Dynasty and drove the Mongols back north (to Mongolia).
* The uprising began after the Mongols began discriminating against Chinese officials, preferring Mongol officials instead.  This with heavy taxation, forced labor (e.g., hereditary jobs), and corruption fueled the rebellion.
#### Zhu Yuanzhang
* Zhu Yuanzhang (1328-1398, r. 1368-1398) was a monk who lost his family during a famine and since 1352, became an exceptional leader during the Red Turban movement.
  * In 1367, he captured the Yuan capital, Dadu (located at modern-day Beijing), and declared himself emperor of the Ming dynasty.
* He was partially responsible for the design of Beijing, which was a relatively-large, walled city, as well as the forbidden city in the center.
