# Tang Dynasty
* The Tang was known as a "cosmopolitan" empire because of its openness to foreigners, culture, ideas, and trade.
* The Sui was responsible for unifying the Northern and Southern dynasties, and were successful in many large-scale infrastructure projects, such as contructing the grand canal and repairing the great wall.
  * However, the Sui eventually fell when taxes increased and a power concentration at the top, and a peasant rebellion occurred
* Tang inherited much of the law code from the Sui, which was built upon both Northern and Southern dynasty traditions.
  * The code of 653, consisted of a list specifying penalties to be imposed on those found guilty of crimes.

## Taizong (626-649)
* Taozong is considered to be a co-founder of the Tang dynasty.
* He was a talented military leader involved in the conquest of the three kingdoms in Korea at the time.
* He killed his cousins, his brothers, and his brother's sons to become emperor, and overall ruled three times longer than his father.

## Empress Wu (Wu Zetian, 660-705)
* Wu was originally a concubine of Taizong's successor, Gaozong.
  * She somehow influenced Gaozong so much that Gaozong was planning to install her as empress instead of the previous empress.
  * Gaozong died prematurely from a stroke and Wu took over the government, declared herself empress, and quickly eliminated rivals.
* In 690, a group of Tang princes rose up against her, but her army was loyal enough to her to defeat them.
* She then claimed to start her own dynasty, becoming the only woman in Chinese history to do so.
  * She supported and propagated Buddhism during her reign.
  * Wu also started a civil service exam system to recruit men to office.
* She ruled into her 80's, then passed the title to her son, Zhongzong.
  * Even then, the government was dominated by his wife and sister, until they were out-manipulated by her grandson, Xuanzong.
### Culture
#### Buddhism
* Xuanzang (602-664) was a person who made a trip from India to China in an effort to spread Buddhist belief
  * China was considered the "Edge" of the world in Buddhist belief; India was the center.
  * He was attempting to bring more scriptures and new text to China (and indirectly, prevent the belief in China from diverging)
  * His journey was the inspiration for the novel "Journey to the West" (西遊記).

#### Art
* A lot of the art during this time was related to Buddhism
  * In one case, there was a series of cave paintings done by someone, and sealed off; the cave was not found until recently (the 1900's).
* Chinese calligraphy became considered as a fine art
* India, as well as many other civilizations were particularly interested in Chinese ceramics.
  * The Tang had three-colored, glazed pottery.  At this point, ceramics are not just made for the practical use, but as a form of art.
* Poetry and literature was particularly important, especially for those looking for higher positions.  The exam that Empress Wu designed required takers to write poems or essays about politics.
  * Some notable poets include
    * Li Bai (701-762), one of the greatest Chinese poets of all time, covered many different topics, including nature, love, daoist belief, friends, etc... the human experience
    * Du Pu (712-770): wrote about the ponderings of older men, and the nostalgia of older China.
    * Bai Juyi (772-846)
    * Han Yu (768-824)
## Xuanzong (712-756)
* The Tang dynasty collapsed during Xuanzong's reign.
* Xuanzong was in love with Yang Guifei, and Yang asked him to appoint her as chancellor.
  * She was not a good chancellor, but Xuanzong was unable to remove him due to their love.
* When An Lushan and his rebels attack the capitol, Xuanzong fled with Guifei.  It was during the time that the capital was under attack and the emperor fled that the other members of the council killed Yang Guifei, and Xuanzong was forced to step down.

## Yang Guifei (719-756)
## Yan Guozhong (d. 756)
* Cousin of Yang Guifei who eventually came into power
## An Lushan (703-757; An Lushan Rebellion 755-763)
