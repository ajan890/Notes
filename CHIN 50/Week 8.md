## High Qing (1644-1800)
* Qing was different from Ming in their government
  * Qing had "secret memorials," or ways to secretly communicate with bureaucrats (and emperor).  Unlike Ming, their communication was always official.
  * Dual governance (continuation of Ming)
  * Used Provincial system from the Yuan dynasty.
  * Qing had a small bureaucracy
    * The job of local bureaucrats was to collect taxes on the land they controlled and pay their share to the government
    * No one needed to pay those taxes, and tax evasion was common
    * Number of bureaucrats assigned to each region is too small compared to the number of bureaucrats needed to collect the taxes
    * Therefore, they had to somehow convince their people to make it easy
* Qing was able to keep the Yellow River from flooding
* Lineages
  * People related to a common ancestor are members of their lineage.
    * Not necessarily descended from (can be married into family)
  * Lineages are important since it was a basis of trust and credit.  People were more likely to trust people in their lineage first before others.  (Same goes with lending money)
  * Lineage was a source of soft power.
  * Geneology is the term relating direct descent
