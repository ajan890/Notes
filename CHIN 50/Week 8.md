## High Qing (1644-1800)
* Qing was different from Ming in their government
  * Qing had "secret memorials," or ways to secretly communicate with bureaucrats (and emperor).  Unlike Ming, their communication was always official.
  * Dual governance (continuation of Ming)
  * Used Provincial system from the Yuan dynasty.
  * Qing had a small bureaucracy
    * The job of local bureaucrats was to collect taxes on the land they controlled and pay their share to the government
    * No one needed to pay those taxes, and tax evasion was common
    * Number of bureaucrats assigned to each region is too small compared to the number of bureaucrats needed to collect the taxes
    * Therefore, they had to somehow convince their people to make it easy
* Qing was able to keep the Yellow River from flooding
* Lineages
  * People related to a common ancestor are members of their lineage.
    * Not necessarily descended from (can be married into family)
  * Lineages are important since it was a basis of trust and credit.  People were more likely to trust people in their lineage first before others.  (Same goes with lending money)
  * Lineage was a source of soft power.
  * Geneology is the term relating direct descent

### Han Learning (Han Xue)
* A new school of thought that came up during the Qing dynasty - to return to Confucianism
  * They believed that Buddhism and Daoism were later additions to the original Confucianism
  * Focused a lot on old scriptures and the classics.

### The Great Divergence
* In the mid 1800's, China was the most commercialized areas in the world.
* They had trade centers - essentially distribution hubs for many different resources.
  * During this time, grain moved by trade instead of tax
  * Tax was paid in cash instead of grain.
  * These trade centers allowed European powers to exploit the trade later on.
* Qing was kind of Laissez-Faire with its commerce.  Internally, cities boomed and big businesses popped up along the Yangze river and along the east coast.
  * Externally, there were a lot of new problems - specifically foreign powers wanting to exploit the business, including Japan, Western powers, etc.
  * Kangxi allowed exports and international trade, but limited the amount of external trade.
    * Unlike before, international traders were required to pay a tribute to the government.
    * Many foreign powers, especially Great Britain, pushed against these limits.
