## The Revolutionary State
### "Let a hundred flowers bloom" (1956) and Anti-Rightist Campaign (1957-1959)
* "Let a hundred flowers bloom" was a phrase associated with Mao Zedong's Hundred Flowers Campaign, to encourage intellectuals and citizens to openly express their criticisms of the Communist regime to foster cultural and political diversity.
  * The government was initially accepting of the criticism, but changed their stance and started branding the critics as "rightists" and punishing them through imprisonment, forced labor, and other forms of persecution.  The campaign to systematically persecute the critics is referred to as the Anti-Rightist Campaign.
* The government was structured as a hierarchy.
  * The top was the Standing Committee of the Politburo, a group of a few people who are at the top which execute orders for the Politburo.  (currently 7 members)
  * Next, is the Politburo, which is the key decision-making group, consisting of about 24 people.  (12 people at the time, now it is 24)
  * Below them are the central committee (consisting of hundreds of members), which are representatives voted up.
### Great Leap Forward (1958-1962)
* Mao Zedong wanted to "leap its way through the political structures"
  * Marxist writings suggest that governments will always pass through capitalism, socialism, then reaching communism, where communism is the "ideal" and best form of government.  Mao wanted to skip all the steps in the middle
* To do this, he combined backyards into massive communal farms, and issued massive quotas for grain production.
  * He also made steel production in decentralized, backyard furnaces.
  * He encouraged new agricultural practices, such as deep plowing, planting grain closer together, etc.  Importantly, these practices were not researched well.
* Leaders of groups in the agrarian countryside often lied about having surplusses, since no one wanted to give bad news to those at the top.
  * This led to policy decisions based on false data.
  * After the government relocated people from the countryside (due to their perception that there were plenty of surplusses), there was not enough people to harvest the grain, since in reality they were not producing enough, and therefore it was left in the fields to rot.
  * Steel produced in the decentralized furnaces were of low quality, and the majority produced was not usable.
  * This lead to the famine of 1959-1962.
### Famine: "Three Hard Years" (1959-1962)
* As agricultural output plummeted, 15-45 million people died due to starvation
* The lack of agriculture caused economic instability.
* Mao's reputation was severely damaged as a result.  Mao stepped back and lets Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping implement corrective reforms.
* **Liu Shaoqi**:
  * Mao Zedong's hand-picked successor
  * He ended up being purged by Mao, after fears that he may compete with Mao himself.
* **Lin Biao**:
  * Replaced Liu Shaoqi after he was purged.  Mao ended up purging him too.
  * Dies in a mysterious plane crash in 1971, while (presumably) fleeing to the Soviet Union.
* **Deng Xiaopeng**:
  * Held power before Mao died, but became the de facto leader afterwards.
  * He is credited by giving China economic power through market reforms.
### Cultural Revolution (1966-1976)
* A (literally) cultural revolution initiated by Mao Zedong aimed to purge anything capitalist, or 'right'.
  * During this time, people would travel from city to city, waving their Red Books, and purging people who were conservative.
    * Red books were essentially a book of quotes from Mao Zedong and symbolized loyalty to the communist regime.
  * This revolution was essentially run by the young people, or the newer generation at the time, referred to as **Red Guards**.  They acted as the enforcers of revolutionary ideology.
  * During this period, historical relics, temples, and art were destroyed (mostly burned) to eradicate traditional culture.
  * Schools and universities were shut down for years, and factories and farms were disrupted by political struggles, leading to declines in productivity.
  * Millions were imprisoned, sent to labor camps, or killed.
* **Jiang Qing** (1914-1991)
  * She was Mao Zedong's wife for some time, and gained some political influence through that connection.
  * She was aligned with three other radical leaders to form to **Gang of Four**, a faction that controlled propaganda, culture, and political purges.
### Afterword: June 4, 1989
* After the death of Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaopeng became the leader, and purged those that supported Mao Zedong, claiming that he produced an entire generation of degenerates.
* The Gang of Four were persecuted after Mao Zedong died.
* However, his supporters (The Red Guard) were still around, and they protested in Tiannanmen Square.  Some protesters went on hunger strikes, calling for democratic freedoms.  Some protested the government's lack of response to their demands.
* On May 20, 1989, a month before the massacre, the Chinese government declared martial law in Beijing and began deploying military.  However, protesters refused to leave.
* June 4, 1989 was the day of the Tiannanmen Square Massacre, where Deng called upon his military to suppress the protests.  Hundreds to thousands of protesters were killed by gunfire and shells.
  * The iconic _Tank Man_ image of a protestor standing in front (and blocking) a line of tanks left deep impressions on the world outside of China, symbolizing resistance to government oppression.  The protestor's fate is unknown, but most likely killed.
* This response from the government angered the other countries of the world (condemned by pretty much all other developed countres). USA and the EU set up economic embargos, arms embargos, travel bans, and cut relations.  Japan and Australia also condemned China, and suspended economic aid.
* China started mass censoring.
* **Liu Xiaobo** (1955-2017)
  * Literary scholar, with a Ph.D. in literature from Beijing Normal University.
  * Active in the Tiannanmen Square protests
  * Was repeatedly arrested and imprisoned by the Chinese government after continuing to push for political reforms, freedom of speech, and democracy.
  * Author of *Charter 08* (2008), a bold petition calling for political reforms, human rights, and democracy in China.  This document was heavily censored by the government.
  * Won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 for his work.
