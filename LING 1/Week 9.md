# Week 9
## Animal Language
### Introduction
* Do animals have language?
* Is language unique to humans?
* If not, are animal communication systems fundamentally different from human language?

### Popular Media
* In the popular media, animals, primates in particular, are presented as having language:<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/224579680-2869c4aa-8a06-4cd7-ae81-51cb45820521.png)<br>
* Is this true?
- We often treat our closest animals similar to the ways we treat other people.
- How do we answer the question:
  - “Do animals have language?
- Let’s consider some other questions first:
  - Is Barack Obama the 44th US present? Are they the same?
  - Is Caryn Johnson the same as Whoopi Goldberg, no matter how dressed?
  - Is Melopsittacus undulates the same as a parakeet?
- What would you need to know to answer that question?
  - You need to know what Melopsittacus undulates looks like, for example.

- To figure out whether animals have language, we need to know the properties of human language

### Language vs. Communication
- Language and communication are commonly conflated, but they are actually different
- Communication is a near universal among living things.
- Even bacteria communicate with each other, using chemical signaling molecules! (Quorum sensing)
- Communication can happen even when the communicator doesn’t intend it to!<br>

- How to distinguish language from communication?
- Communication is something that we do.
- Language is a tool that we use

## Types of Communication
* Visual Communication
* Auditory communication
* Tactile communication
* Olfactory communication
* These are all examples of animals communicating
* However, they are not using language the way humans do.

### Visual Communication
* Saguaro cactus *Carnegiea gigantea*<br>

* Example: Fireflies
  * Males glow when trying to attract females

### Auditory Communication
* Who are male birds singing to?
* Whales communicate auditorily too

### Tactile communication
* Example:
  * Social grooming<br>

### Chemical/Olfactory Communication
* Some animals can communicate by scent alone, such as skunks.

## Case Studies of Language in Animals
### Clever Hans
* Horse, early 1990s
* Wilhelm von Osten, a high school teacher and horse trainer.
* Von Osten believed that the reason horses and other animals seemed to be less intelligent than humans was primarily because of a lack of educational opportunities
* Von Osten taught Hans to:
  * Tell time
  * Keep track of the calendar
  * Read, and spell in German
  * Add, subtract, multiply, divide
  * Respond correctly to verbal or written questions
* Hans would tap out the answer to a question or shake his head a number of times that corresponded to the right answer
* Hans didn’t always get the right answer, but when he did, he was rewarded with a carrot
* The Board of Education appointed a committee to investigate Von Osten’s claims
* Commission was a veterinarian, a circus manager, a cavalry officer, school teachers, and director of the Berlin Zoo
* In 1904, the commission concluded that there was no deception involved
* Von Osten seems to have been quite sincere in his beliefs
* The Hans Commission found:
  * No tricks involved
  * Oskar Pfungst, psychologist, continued testing
* Under some conditions, Hans did much worse in getting correct answers:
  * Isolated from an audience
  * Blinders on Hans
  * Questioner didn’t know answer
* Pfungst’s tests found Clever Hans was responding to reactions of his owner and the audience!
* Hans was picking up on unconscious, involuntary movements of the body, changes in facial expression, and maybe even changes in heartbeat
* Pfungst could get Hans to start tapping just by stepping in front of him and making slight movements, without posing a question at all!
* The tapping stopped when Pfungst straightened his head slightly
### Alex the Parrot
- Alex the parrot:
  - African Grey parrot, born 1976, died 2007
  - Trained by Dr. Irene Pepperberg (U. Arizona) since 1977.
  - Impressive ability to speak/understand… for a parrot
- Pepperberg taught Alex the “meaningful use of English speech”
- Model/Rival Training:
  - Trainer + model/rival + parrot
- Trainer presents objects to the model/rival and queries them about it
  - Correct: Get the item
  - Incorrect: Get corrective feedback
- The only reward is the object talked about, but after a correct response the parrot can request something that it wants (e.g., a nut)
- “Alex exhibited cognitive capacities comparable to those of marine mammals, apes, and sometimes 4-year-old children.”
- Alex correctly labeled:
  - 50+ objects
  - 7 colors
  - 5 Shapes
  - Quantities up to 6
- He correctly used:
  - “No”
  - “Come here”
  - “Wanna go X”
  - “Want Y”
- He understood the concepts of “bigger”, “smaller”, “same”, and “different”
- Described a key as a key, no matter what its size or color, could determine how the key was different from others.
- Speech sounded remarkably accurate… produced very differently from humans.
- Answered simple questions about objects. (e.g. about size, color, material)
- Required immense amounts of training
- Pepperberg does not say that Alex learned a language.
- Pepperberg’s research interest is in concept formation in animals, not language

---

* Hans was pretty clever!
* Alex the Parrot was really extraordinary.
* But we have to distinguish being intelligent from the ability to acquire human language.

## Properties of Human Language
### Interchangeability
- A user can both transmit and receive messages:
- Not all animal communication displays this flexibility:
- In silkworm moths, only females secrete chemicals
- In whistling moths, only males make territorial sounds
- In most species of fireflies, only the males “light up”
- In most songbirds, only males sing

### Cultural Transmission
- Nature vs nurture
- At least some aspect of a communication system is learned from other users (environment)
- Animal communication systems vary
- Fireflies and cowbirds
- Entirely innate language systems
- Birdsong can be learned, innate or a combo of both:
- Young phoebes sing nearly correctly at two weeks
- Phoebes will sing correctly if raised in isolation from other phoebes
- Phoebes sing correctly even if deafened after hatching

#### Cultural Transmission in Animals
- In some species, there is a critical period for the acquisition of of song
- White crowned sparrow:
  - Hatchlings start producing subsongs around 25-40 days.
  - The subsong consists of soft vocalizations that are not the adult song (unstructured)
  - 75-80 days: “Plastic song” is recognizable as species song
  - 90 days: “Crystallization;” the song is fixed
  - 240 days: Full song
- Song Sparrow:
  - Critical period for the acquisition of birdsong is from 20-70 days.
  - Bird only exposed from days 3-7:
  - Will produce abnormal song
  - Bird only exposed from 50-71:
  - Some deterioration in adult song, since exposure is late in critical period
  - Bird only exposed after 300 days:
  - Only subsong produced. Not recognizable as characteristic of the species
  - Bird only exposed from days 35-56:
  - Normal development

### Arbitrariness
- No natural or necessary connection between a linguistic form and its meaning; it’s an arbitrary relationship
- “Cat” in English is wundu in Wolof, but there is no change in the cats themselves
- In signed languages too, the relation between linguistic form and meaning is arbitrary

### Duality of Patterning
- System decomposable into smaller, recombinable parts
- A, p, r, t combine to form “trap”, “part”, “rapt”
- Smaller units recombine into larger units at two levels:
- Sounds combine to form words, which have meaning.
  - (Sounds by themselves have no meaning)
- Words combine to form sentences, which have meaning
- This doesn’t seem to be found in most animals communication systems:
- In most animals the meaningful elements are not decomposable into smaller units of analysis

#### Duality of Patterning in Alex the Parrot?
- Alex, the Parrot seemed to have meaningful words, rather than meaningful sentences
- Alex did learn some fixed phrases, but these were not recombined

### Displacement:
- Human language can talk about the past, present and future.
- Abstract concepts:
  - Things that do not exist in real life or are not tangible.
  - E.g. unity, superman, batman, Santa Claus.
- We can talk about places that are extremely distant and that we have never visited:
  - Other galaxies, other dimensions
- Most animal communication systems lack this property
- Howler Monkey makes his alarm call when he things he spot jaguar (a stuffed jaguar)

#### Displacement in Animal Communication
- Three types of Bee “dances”:
  - Round dance = relatively close
  - Sickle dance = intermediate close
  - Tail-wagging dance = relatively far
- Bees have limited displacement abilities
- Alex the Parrot could also ask for objects that were not present

### Prevarication
- Language can describe things that are not literally understood as true (imaginary)
- We can lie with language, but slightly different
- Careful here. Deception requires a Theory of Mind

### Ambiguity
- Words in human languages can have several different meanings
- In animal communication systems, there is no ambiguity. Each call/signal has one meaning

### Productivity
- Unlimited potential to express novel ideas
- Humans are capable of creating new expressions for new objects -infinite
- Animals have limited set of signals to choose from - fixed reference
- They cannot produce any new signals to describe novel experiences

### Grammar
- Human languages have models of grammar:
  - Phonetics
  - Phonology
  - Morpholoy
  - Syntax
- Signed languages share all of these modules as well.
- If any of these are found in animal communication systems, they exist only in very rudimentary forms.

## Language of Animals
### Vervet Monkeys
* Since humans are primates, it may be useful to look at our closest relatives to see if they can acquire and use language
* **Vervets** (*Cercopithecus aethiops*) are Old World monkeys.
  * Found in the savannah, forest, semi-desert of sub-Saharan Africa
  * Adult males approximately 10 lbs, adult females approximately 8 lbs.
* Vervets have three kinds of predators:
  1. **Large cats:** Leopards that chase on the ground
  2. **Eagles:** Martial eagle and other large birds that fly in and attack (with an eagle sighting it's best to hide in bushes)
  3. **Snakes:** Pythons, mambas, cobras
  * Vervets are so famous because they have different alarm calls for each type of predator.
    * **Leopard alarm: Loud bark**
    * **Eagle alarm: Cough**
    * **Snake alarm: "Chutter"**
  * These three different alarm calls correspond to three different behaviors in other vervets:
    * **Leopard alarm:** Run to the trees, vervets in tree climb higher
    * **Eagle alarm:** Look up, climb down trees, run into the bushes
    * **Snake alarm:** Stand up on hind legs and look around.
  * In one experiment, researchers repeatedly played a recording of the leopard alarm from **individual A** to other troop members. (Where there was no leopard around and individual A was absent)
  * After this, they played the alarm call from a *different* vervet, **individual B**.  The vervets responded normally.
  * The other vervets also responded normally to individual A's eagle and snake alarms.
  * Solitary vervets do not give alarm calls.
    * Calls seem to be intended as communication to other conspecifics, not just an expression of anxiety or fear.
    * More alarm calling takes place among close kin or offspring than peripherally related group members.
* **Are vervet alarm calls a type of language?**
  * Let's check:
    * **Interchangeability:**
      * Yes, both sexes give alarm calls.
    * **Arbitrariness:**
      * Yes, alarm calls themselves do seem arbitrarily related to their referents.  For example, leopard alarm does not obviously sound like a leopard.
    * **Duality of patterning:**
      * No, the alarm calls do not seem to have any internal structure.  They are **not** combinable.
    * **Displacement:**
      * Not really.  These alarm calls, **typically**, are only performed in presence of appropriate predator.
      * An exception:
        * Two groups of vervets were fighting and one group was clearly losing.  In the losing group, one member gave leopard alarm call.  All the monkeys ran for the trees and the fight stopped, but there was no leopard!  The calling monkey couldn't have been frightened by a leopard, because there wasn't one present.  This suggests that the alarm calls are intentional and that the vervet system displays **limited displacement.**
      * However, we have no evidence of vervets 'discussing' predators in their absence.  
    * **Prevarication:**
      * As seen in displacement, it looks like vervets **can** use the alarm calls for prevarication.
    * **Ambiguity:**
      * No.  The calls are unambiguous and refer to specific classes of predators.
    * **Productivity:**
      * There seem to be three basic alarm calls.
      * In some forested areas, dogs might be encountered that work for human hunters.  Shouting and climbing into a tree would not help in evading the real danger.
      * In these areas, the vervets have developed another call, a "dog alarm," which is short and quiet.
      * When other vervets hear it, they sneak into the bush where hunters cannot follow.
      * Massively different than productivity in humans!
    * **Cultural Transmission:**
      * The calls can't be wholly innate since they seem to be deployed at will.
      * There is some learning since vervets in forested areas have developed a "dog alarm."
      * Young vervets give the eagly alarm for a wide variety of large birds, not just for the species that prey on vervets.
      * On **one** occasion, a falling leaf elicited the eagle call from a young vervet.
      * By the time they're adults, vervets have substantially refined their "eagle" category.
  * Conclusions:
    * Vervets are clearly intelligent and their calls are sophisticated.
    * There is some overlap in the properties of the vervet alarm call system and human language.
    * But overall, the two seem quite distinct!

### Teaching Language to Chimpanzees
#### Gua (Kellogg and Kellogg, 1933):
* The chimpanzee Gua was raised in a human home and treated like human infant, along with the couple's son.
* Gua and the child shared many similarities.<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/224539496-e4b99de5-ecc2-4684-8091-d8e10ef0a33f.png)<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/224539520-781828b5-5c00-4eb5-a4dc-32ebdbd9ec98.png)<br>
* Gua's motor skills even exceded the child's.
* Despite this, Gua **never learned to speak** (the child did)
* Gua was able to understand 100 words, but she did not produce any intelligible words.
#### Viki (1940 and 50's)
* **Viki**, raised in a human home and actively taught to produce words.
* By age 6, Viki could say "mama", "papa", "cup", "up".
* Viki produced poorly articulated versions of "mama", "papa", and "cup".

#### Differences in Vocal Tract
* Teaching chimpanzees to speak a language didn't work out very well!
* Problem: Chimpanzees have a vocal tract that makes speech production essentially impossible.<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/224541979-26288e74-11c3-467d-9bbc-c6262ac60cdf.png)<br>
* Larynx is much higher in non-human primates.
* Same is true for human infants, but around 3 months of age, it moves lower.
* Lower larynx makes an animal sound larger, help vocalization and vowel production.
* Humans have it permanently low, and it grows even lower in human male adolescents.
* Maybe problem is teaching chimpanzees to speak.

#### Sign Language
* In 1960s, linguists were beginnning to recognize that signed languages have all the structural properties of spoken languagem except for modality.
* Scientists reasoned that teaching a primate a signed language might work because their manual gestures are at least as dexterous as humans.
* **Washoe (Gardner and Gardner, 1960s)**
  * Captured in Africa as a baby.
  * Started to learn language at 11 months, teaching period for about 51 months.
  * Idea: Chimps use gestures as a natural sign in their communication
  * Tried to teach her ASL, American Sign Language.
  * The Gardners used the "molding" technique, in which a teacher would show her an object, then mold Washoe's hands into the correct sign configuration.
  * By 60 months, when the project ended, Washoes had acquired about 160 signs.
  * By 27 years, about 250 signs.
  * Washoe could extend a sign she learned for a specific object to the entire class of that object.
  * Some of Washoe's multi-word utterances:
    > "Washoe sorry." <br>
    > "Baby clown." <br>
    > "Go in." <br>
    > "Hug hurry." <br>
    > "Out open please hurry!"<br>
  * However, there are severe problems with the data from Washoe.
    * Neither the Gardners nor any of their assistants were actually fluent in ASL!
    * Despite claims in media, Washoe **never** acquired ASL.  She couldn't have since she was **never** exposed to it!
  * How do we know that Washoe was actually making ASL sigs and not just gesturing?
  * The Gardners allowed a lot of sloppiness in Washoe's signs, since her hands were not exactly shaped like a human's.
  * In double blind experiments, Washoe gave signs referring to an object that the observers coding Washoe's signs couldn't see.
  * Interpretations of Washoe's responses corresponded to the intended object about 60% of the time.
  * Difficult to interpret this because we don't know the size of the set of objects on any particular trial.  It could be that Washoe was at chance!
  * Is there evidence that Washoe had any linguistic structure beyond stringing together signs?
    * There are some reported examples like:
    * "GIVE TICKLE."
    * "GO SWEET."
    * "OPEN FLOWER."
    * The last two are ungrammatical in ASL, by the way.
  * Washoe was doing more than imitating, but clearly didn't control the grammar of ASL.
  * One major methodological problem is that in the 1960s, not much was known about the structure of ASL.
  * The Gardners really taught Washoe something like English but using signs, which is **not** ASL.
  * The researchers asked her questions like:
    > "What's that?"<br>
    > "Who's that?"<br>
    > "Where we go?"<br>
    > etc.<br>
  * These questions present big data problems.
    * Washoe was shown a picture of a dog and asked "WHAT'S THAT?"
      * If she responded "GRAPE", it was counted as correct.
      * The Gardners were interested in whether she knew the category "common noun."
    * If she was asked "WHAT COLOR THAT?" about the same dog and she responded "ORANGE," it counted as correct, because she signed the category (color).
  * Many of Washoe's answers involved more than one sign.
  * But these sign sequences were systematically simplified when they were coded by eliminating all repetition.
  * In response to "WHAT WANT?", Washoe might sign "YOU ME YOU OUT ME", which would then be truncated to "YOU ME OUT" and coded as "WE OUT."
  * "WE OUT" looks like a plausible answer, but we can't tell how much it was intended as a response to the question and how much is the experimenter's interpretation.
  * All we have are the reduced codings.
  * "YOU ME YOU TICKLE ME YOU TICKLE TICKLE ME YOU" got coded as "YOU TICKLE ME", which looks far more like language than the signed form from Washoe!
  * **Conclusions:**
    * Washoe did **not** acquire American Sign Language.
    * The data form the study is difficult to interpret.
    * Washoe project strongly suggests that it's possible to teach a chimpanzee a substantial vocabulary of arbitrary signs with associated meaning.
    * There is little to no evidence of any linguistic structure in Washoe's signs, and certainly no evidence for even a substantial command of any human language.
* **Nim Chimpsky**
  * Psychologist Herbert Terrace studied **Nim Chimpsky** (named for the linguist Noam Chomsky).
  * 2 week old captive-born chimpanzee
  * For first 18 months lived with a human family that had a non-native ASL signer.
  * After this, he moved to a mansion in upstate NY.
  * **9 months:** systematic language training began.
    * 5 hours a day, 5 days a week.
    * Trainers were **not** fluent in ASL.
    * Used the hand molding method like the Gardner's.
  * After 4 months of training, Nim's first sign: "DRINK."
  * After 3 years and 8 months, about 125 signs.
  * Nim signed a lot: about 20000 multi-sign utterances.
  * But these are not **unique** utterances.
  * Nim never learned ASL (not a surprise).
  * **Linguistic Structure:**
    * In his multi-word signs, there are tendencies, but no apparent rules, like in human language.
    * Majority of Nim's (and Washoe's) multi-signs can be classified into categories like:
      * Agent-action
      * Action-object
      * Modifier-modified
      * And a few others.
    * But these multi-signs have semantic relations, not necessarily structural (syntactic) ones.
    * In some cases like action-object, the signs occur with equal frequency in either order.
    * That is, action-object ("KICK BALL") was just as frequent as object-action ("BALL KICK").
    * This suggests a lack of linguistic structure.
    * Nim did things, like massive repetition, that human children never do:
      > "GIVE ORANGE ME GIVE EAT ORANGE ME EAT ORANGE GIVE ME EAT ORANGE GIVE ME YOU."<br>
    * Combinations that Nim produced are very different from those of a human child.
    * Very repetitive, no additional complexity:
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/224544438-8b19c22e-d9df-4c3e-a02c-1f0f81111602.png)<br>
    * 1979 paper by Terrace and colleagues had a tremendous effect on ape language studies.
    * The discourse context of Nim's utterances **directly reflected the teacher's signing!**
    * Many multi-sign utterances Nim's made were initiated by the teacher, and involved signs that occurred immediately before the teacher's utterance.
    * The amount of signs where the structure resulted form Nim's control of language was very small, and provides no evidence for linguistic structure or regularities.
    * Much of the supposed evidence of Nim's use of syntax comes from prompted utterances that were at least partially repetitive.
    * In Nim's utterances:
      * 90% were reactions (Almost always referring to "here and now")
      * 40% were straight repetition.
        * Interrupts the signing of teacher.
        * Does not add new information to the situation.
    * **Conclusions of Num study:**
      * Nim Chimpsky **never** acquired American Sign Language, or any other human language.
      * Discourse context shows that the majority of the data from Nim's signing was just Nim repeating the teacher's signs.

* **Koko the Gorilla**
  * **Koko** is a lowland gorilla.
  * Francine (Penny) Patterson has been working with Koko since 1972, when Koko was one year old.
  * In the popular media, Koko is famous because she is portrayed as having "really" learned ASL.
  * Despite her fame, there is not much to say linguistically about Koko, except that there is no data to support the claim that she has acquired ASL.
  * Patterson has not provided anything except summaries, charts of vocabulary growth, and isolated anecdotes about Koko's abilities.
  * 3.5 years: 100 signs
  * 5 years: 250 signs.
  * Currently vocabulary of 1000 signs and understands written English.
  * Patterson says that she keeps systematic records like transcripts of Koko's signing and videotapes, etc.
  * But nobody has been able to study them!
  * Since 1981, information about Koko has only been available in forms like National Geographic specials, and stories in the press.
  * There have also been internet "chat" sessions with Patterson action as the interpreter in both directions.
  * Examples from the live internet chat with Koko:<br>
    > **Questioner:** Is Koko aware that she's chatting with thousands of people now?<br>
    > **Koko:** Good here.<br>
    > **Dr. Patterson:** Koko is aware.<br>
    > **Questioner:** Do you like to chat with other people?<br>
    > **Koko:** Fine nipple.<br>
    > **Dr. Patterson:** Nipple rhymes with people, she doesn't sign people per se, she was trying to do a "sounds like..."<br>
    > **Questioner:** Are you going to have a baby in the future?<br>
    > **Dr. Patterson:** OK, is that for Koko? Koko are you going to have a baby in the future?<br>
    > **Koko:** Koko-love eat ... (sips).<br>
    > **Questioner:** Me too!<br>
    > **Dr. Patterson:** What about a baby? You going to have baby? She's just thinking... her hands are together...<br>
    > **Koko:** Unattention.<br>
    > **Dr. Patterson:**  Oh poor sweetheart.  She said "unattention." She covered her face with her hands, which means it's not happening, basically, or it hasn't happened yet... I don't see it.<br>
    > **Questioner:** That's sad!<br>
    > **Dr. Patterson:** It is responding to the question. In other words, she hasn't had one yet, and she doesn't see a future here. The way the situation is actually with Koko and Ndume, she has 2 males to 1 female which is the reverse of what she needs. I think that is why she said that, because in our current situation, it isn't possible for her to have a baby.  She needs several females and one male to have a family.<br>
  * This does not lend confidence to the idea that Koko has acquired human language!
### Chimp and Other Primate Studies
#### Overview
* **20th century hypotheses:**
  * Maybe chimps (and other primates) don't use human language because of lack of opportunity to learn it?
  * However, attempts to teach chimps spoken language failed because chimp vocal tracts not suited to speech.
  * Maybe instead, they can acquire sign language?
  * Attempt to teach sign language failed as well.
* **Chimps' and primates' accomplishments:**
  * Can learn to associate referents with arbitrary signs.
  * Can learn to use signs spontaneously.
  * Can learn to use signs creatively (on rare occasions).
* **Chimps' and primates' limitations:**
  * No grammatical structure! (Syntax, morphology)
  * Length: 2-3 sign utterances.
  * Inconsistent word order.
