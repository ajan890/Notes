## First Language Acquisition (FLA)
### Four Facts
* How do children acquire their first language?
* **Fact 1:** Who is the teacher?
* **Fact 2:** What is the input data?
* **Fact 3:** How do children interpret novel data
* **Fact 4:** What errors do children make?

#### Fact 1: Who is the teacher?
* Study: McNeil, 1966
* A mother’s attempt to instruct her child regarding adult English:
  > Child: “Nobody don’t like me.”<br>
  > Mom: “No, say ‘nobody likes me’”<br>
  > Child: “Nobody don’t like me. (x8)”<br>
  > Mom: “No, now listen carefully…say ‘nobody likes me.’”<br>
  > Child: “Oh! Nobody don’t likes me.’”<br>
* Instructive teaching does not play a primary role in first language acquisition
* Children acquire their first language effortlessly, without any systematic instruction

#### Fact 2: What is the input data?
* Compare the following:
  > Sentence A: "You like to eat eggs with bacon"<br>
  > Question A: "What do you like to eat with bacon?"<br>
  > Sentence B: "You like to eat eggs and bacon"<br>
  > Question B: \*"What do you like to eat and bacon?" (incorrect)<br>
* How do we know Question A is grammatical, but Question B is ungrammatical
* Adults, aside from speech errors and jokes, only utter grammatical sentences. (Positive Evidence)
* Ambient linguistic data available to children (input) does not include ungrammatical sentences. (Negative Evidence)
* The only input available to children is positive evidence

#### Fact 3: How do Children interpret Novel Data?

* You can probably understand these sentences, which you most likely have never heard before
* Children are exposed to only a finite number of sentences.
* However, they eventually acquire the ability to generate and understand an infinite number of sentences

#### Fact 4: What errors do children make?
* Children make “errors” in that they sometimes utter sentences adults, as matured speakers of a language, would not utter
* But the pattern of their “errors” seems to be selective or limited
* They would not make certain errors that would be overgeneralized from what they hear in adult speech.

* **Regular vs. Irregular verbs**
  * Regular verbs generate past forms via morphologial attachment of -ed:
    > Walk → walked<br>
    > Call → called<br>
    > Kick → kicked<br>
  * Irregular verbs do not attach -ed for past forms:
    > Go→went (not \*goed)<br>
    > Do → did (not \*doed)<br>
    > Have → had (not \*haved)<br>

* **Children’s “errors”**
  * Children overgeneralize the use of -ed by attaching it to irregular verbs
    > \*"I haved it" (incorrect) <br>
  * Children’s non-adult-like error occur in selective, systematic, limited way.
  * They do say:
    > "I doed it"<br>
    > "I haved it"<br>
  * Children do not overgernalize the -ed attachment to “do” and “have” when they function as auxiliary verbs.
  * They do not say:
    > “Doed you come?”<br>
    > “I haved eaten”<br>

* **Auxiliary verbs**
  * Verbs “do” and “have  serve as auxiliary verbs and they both show up in question:
    * Sentence: you like tacos.
    * Question: Do you like tacos?
    * Sentence : I have eaten
    * Question: Have I eaten?

* **Poverty of the stimulus**
* Four facts about children acquiring first language:
  * No instruction is involved
  * No negative evidence is available (only positive evidence is available)
  * Finite input, but infinite productivity
  * Non-adult-like errors. (but in a selective, limited way)
* Known as the Logical problem of Language Acquisition
* Despite this logical problem, children still typically acquire language with little effort
* “Poverty of the Stimulus”
  * Input from the child’s linguistic environment does not seem to be enough for first language acquisition

### Models of First Language Acquisition
* Hypothesis regarding first language acquisition:
  * Theory of limitation (X)
  * Theory of correction/reinforcement
  * Theory of innateness

#### Theory of Imitation
* Common sense view:
* Children imitate what adults say (like parrots)
  > \*"I finded Renee" (incorrect)<br>
  > \*"Cowboy did fighting me"(incorrect)<br>
  > \*"What the boy hit?"(incorrect)<br>
  > \*"A my pencil"(incorrect)<br>
  > \*"I broomed it up"(incorrect)<br>
* Are children imitating adult speech by uttering these sentences?
  * Do adults also utter such sentences?
* Children make “errors” that adults do not make:
  > \*“What does he doesn’t eat?”<br>
  > \*“Why could he couldn’t wash his hands?”<br>
  > \*"What do you think what’s in this box?"<br>
* Because these sentences are ungrammatical, adult English speakers do not utter them
  * Therefore, this cannot be imitation

#### Theory of Correction/Reinforcement
* Common sense view:
* Language learning is based on the correction of “bad” sentences (by adults), along with:
  * Positive reinforcement for correct speech.
  * Negative reinforcement for incorrect speech

* Father/child conversation:
  > "Want other one spoon, daddy!"<br>
  > "You mean you want the other spoon?"<br>
  > "Yes, I want the other one spoon please daddy"<br>
  > "Can you say the other spoon"<br>
  > "One..other..spoon"<br>
  > "Say other"<br>
  > "Other"<br>
  > "Say spoon"<br>
  > "Spoon"<br>
  > "Other spoon"<br>
  > "Other spoon. Now give me other one spoon"<br>
* Do we really see reinforcement?:
  > "Daddy, I **\*showded** Sara my new shoes!"<br>
* Those aren’t new, they're your big sisters!
* There seems to be no systematic positive or negative reinforcement from adults

* **Study: Brown & Hanlon 1970**
  * Adults expressed approval after 45% of the grammatical sentences.
  * Adults expressed approval after 45% of the ungrammatical sentences.
  * This study provided evidence that adults tend to correct factual content and meaning of children's utterances, not the syntax or grammar
  * This does not bode well for any theory of language learning involving correction or reinforcement
  * So it looks like…
    * Parents are not successfully reinforcing or correcting their children’s language
    * Children are doing more than just imitating their parents.
    * The theories of imitation and correction/reinforcement seem to factually incorrect

* **Study: Heath (1983), Piedmont, Carolinas:**
  * “Adults in Trackton do not see babies or young children as suitable partners for regular conversation…Unless they wish to issue a warning, give a command, provide a recommendation or engage the child in a teasing exchange, adults rarely address speech specifically to young children”
    * <em>The Language Instinct</em> (Pinker)
  * “This is not unreasonable. After all, young children plainly cannot understand a word you say. So why waste your breath in soliloquies”

* **Inuit culture in Canada:**
  * Inuit children in Canada:
  * Socialized to be silent with adults, rather than verbally expressive.
  * From one inuit elder:
    * “You know that a child is acquiring the language when they know what they are being asked to do.”
  * Inuit mothers typically do not:
    * Engage in vocal play with their children
    * Try to interpret the child’s vocalization as speech
    * Respond to these vocalizations (more interested in children’s comprehension rather than production)

* **K’ICHE’ Mayan of Guatemala**
* K’iche’ parents:
  * Address almost no speech to their babies
  * However, they engage them in “real” conversation when they are around 1.5 to 2 years old.

* **Mohawk tribe of New York and Canada**
  * Mohawk: An Iroquoian language.
  * Mohawk mothers and grandmothers interacting with children spoke at a normal rate of speed.
  * They didn’t simplify the “elaborate prefixation, suffixation, and noun incorporation” that is part of normal Mohawk speech.
    * T-e-se-ra:ta?-k (stay up there!)
  * Mothers interacted with children as though they were true conversation partners.
  * There was “very little correction, repetition, or expansion.”
    * Marianne Mithun (1989)

* **Special Input**
  * Caregivers in different societies interact with young learners in different ways.
  * Some engage in explicit “teaching”; others don’t
  * All that they share in common in the rich verbal environment that the children grow up in
  * All these children learn to speak.
  * No single method can be “essential” – They all work!

#### Theory of Innateness
* Noam Chomsky (1928-)
* **Model of innateness:**
  * Developed with a primary focus on addressing the “Poverty of the Stimulus” argument
  * Our language knowledge is:
    * Innately specified. (Therefore, universal among human beings)
    * Richly structured.
    * Innate knowledge of language is called Universal Grammar (UG), a “blueprint” for language.
  * If language is innate, why do people come to acquire various different languages as their first languages?

* **Innateness: Universal vs. Specific**
  - Universal properties of all human language = UG:
  - Categories of linguistic expressions (Nouns, verbs, subjects, objects, etc.)
  - Structured sentences and phrases **(innate)**
  - Properties specific to the acquired language:
    - How nouns, verbs, subjects, and objects are represented in the language
    - How sentences are structured in the language using these specific parts. **(learned)**

* **Metaphors For Theory of Innateness**
  * UG is like the “seed” of a grammar of any language
  * The seed must be watered with input of a specific language for it to bloom as the fully developed grammar.
  * For example, if you feed the seed of UG with the input of English, you will become a native speaker of English
  * UG is like the Operating System (OS) of a computer:
  * US, like an OS, specifies the structure of knowledge and processes the information that children obtain from input.
  * Variation among specific languages is similar to software:
    * Language, like software, has many variations, but they are limited; they all must work within the OS.

### What is Acquired?
* **Differences between languages:**
  * Head-Initial: Head-Complement (e.g., English)
  * Head-Final: Complement-Head (e.g., Japanese)
  * English: **VP→ V NP**
    > John [ate an apple]
  * Japanese: **VP→ NP V**
    > John-wa [ringo-o tabeta]
  * John  apple     ate
* **Word order Acquisition:**
  * Children need to determine the value of the head direction parameter
* **Phonetic and phonological acquisition:**
  * What are the sounds in the language?
  * What’s their distribution?<br>

### What is Acquisition driven by?
* These examples suggest that language acquisition does not seem to be driven by imitation, correction, or reinforcement.
* Children’s knowledge of language is complex and shows subtle implicit knowledge of rules.
* Since we are not overly taught these things, the claim is that this knowledge/system (i.e. UG) is hard-wired into the human minds/genome.
* UG therefore facilitates first language acquisition, which explains why children develop language so effortlessly, rapidly, and uniformly across species.

## Input and Biology
### Studies on Acquisition in Animals
* Critical Period of Birdsong in **Chaffinch** (type of bird)
  * The chaffinch is “wired” to learn its specific birdsong.
  * But if it is not exposed to birdsong within 10 months, it will never learn its song.
  * Hypothesis: Language Learning in Children is similar to the acquisition of birdsong
    * Both abilities are innate
    * Both require environmental input for full development
    * Both are subject to a critical period
* Critical Period in **Geese**
  * Study Imprinting in Greylag Geese (lorenz, 1965)
  * Within two days, goslings become attached to the first moving object that they see.
  * If there’s no exposure during this critical period, they will shy away from all moving objects
* Critical Period for Vision in **Cats**
  * Study: Blakemore and COoper, 1970
  * Two-week old kittens where assigned to either a vertical condition or horizontal condition
  * At 3 months, kittens were tested to see how well they recognized lines. The results were:
  * Kittens raised in the horizontal condition were “blind” to vertically oriented lines/objects.

### Studies on Acquisition in Humans
* **The Case of “Victor”**
  * Victor of Aveyron (France, 1797)
  * Victor’s language process was generally poor:
  * Able to comprehend language, but practically unable to produce it.
  * Only two pronounced phrases: “milk” and “oh my god!”
  * Majority of communication consisted of grunts and howls
* **The case of “Genie”**
  * Linguists at UCLA found that Genie could learn how to:
  * Communicate a message
    * (verbally or nonverbally)
  * Acquire vocabulary
    * (by age 17, vocab of a typical 5 year old)
  * She could not learn how to use:
    * Grammatical “morphemes”
      * (the, a, -ed past tense)
  * Examples of some of her sentences:
    > “Mike paint:<br>
    > “Open door key:<br>
    > “Man motorcycle have”<br>
    > “Genie bad cold live father house”<br>
    > “Neal come happy; Neal not come sad”<br>
  * Lateralization: Where does Genie process language?
    * Typical brain: the left hemisphere
  * Dichotic listening tests showed:
    * Genie’s language processed in the right hemisphere
  * This suggests that the right hemisphere stepped in to make up for the inaccessible left hemisphere
* **The case of “Chelsea”**
  * Study: Curtiss, 1988
    * Chelsea developed a 2000+ word vocabulary.
    * She is able to hold a job, read, and write.
    * However, she was unable to acquire simple word order or complex syntax
      > “The small a the hat”<br>
      > “Orange Tim car in”<br>
      > “I wanna be driving come."<br>
      > “Breakfast eating girl"<br>
      > “They are is car in the Tim”<br>
* **Late acquisition of American Sign Language**
  * Deaf parents whose children don’t know sign language
    * Exposed to sign language only when they first meet other deaf children
    * Normal early childhood, except for lack of language input.
* **Study: Mayberry, 2011**
  * Researchers compared 3 groups:
    * Native signed (acquired from birth)
    * Early ASL learners (acquired at 5-7 years)
    * Delayed ASL learners (acquired at 8-13 years)
  * Participants were asked if sentences being signed were grammatical:
    * Native signers performed the best.
    * Early learners performed worse than native signers.
    * Delayed learners performed worse than both native signers and early learners
### Second Language Acquisition
* **Study: Oyama (1976)**
  * Italian immigrants learning English:
  * Age of arrival a better predictor of accent than number of years speaking English
* **Study: Oyama (1978)**
  * Age of arrival is a better predictor of comprehension than number of years speaking English. (not just about motor skill learning ability)
* Child Aphasia
  * Lenneberg results for left hemisphere aphasias as a function of age:
    * 0-3 month: no effect
    * 21-36 months: language accomplishments disappear, later re-acquired with repetition of all stages
    * 3-10 years: aphasic symptoms, tendency for full recovery
    * 11 years on: aphasic symptoms persist
### Research Results:
* What are the results from research on the critical period?
  * Humans have an innate ability to acquire language, but we require linguistic input from our environment
  * put must come within a critical period. (biologically determined “window of opportunity”)
  * After the critical period, humans are unable to acquire language with native-like proficiency.

# Summary
* The ability to acquire language is innate
* All children everywhere should be able to:
  * Acquire the language of their environment.
  * Acquire language rapidly and spontaneously.
  * Exhibit linguistic creativity.
    * (i.e. say things they’ve never heard)
  * Pass through similar stages of development
* Learning a first language:
  * No instruction is involved.
  * No negative evidence is available.
  * Finite input, infinite productivity
* Non-adult-like errors
  * (but in a selective, limited way)
  * What model would provide the best explanation about these facts?
* Knowledge of language is acquired on the basis of our innate, biologically programmed structure.
* Universal Grammar (universal)
* Exposure to linguistic input (specific)
### Critical Periods
* Critical period: time window in which exposure to certain and environmental stimuli for normal development
* Critical periods exist for cognitive functions in animals. (like birdsong in chaffinches, or vision in cats)
* Critical periods exist for language acquisition in humans (from birth to the onset of puberty).
* After a critical period has ended, it becomes nearly impossible to acquire language to native-like levels.
* Evidence for a critical period for language come from:
  * Studies of people who had no language input (genie, chelsea)
  * Studies of late vs. early acquisition of ASL.
  * Studies of second language acquisition
  * Studies of childhood aphasia
