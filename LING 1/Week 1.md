## What is Linguistics?

<strong>Linguistics</strong> is the scientific study of language<br>
  * "Scientific" as in the investigations of human language follows the scientific method<br>
    > <strong>Observation:</strong> What do people actually say in the world?<br>
    > <strong>Form Hypothesis:</strong> Why do people say the things that they do?  Why does language have a certain form?<br>
    > <strong>Test Hypothesis:</strong> Go out and gather data about the hypothesis.<br>
    > <strong>Revise Hypothesis:</strong> Is the data consistent with the hypothesis?<br>
    > <strong>Develop theory matching results</strong> What conclusions can be drawn from the data?<br>

## What is Language?

<strong>Language</strong> is a tool for human communication, as well as a form of knowledge.<br>
* A large portion of language occurs in the subconscious.  Part of the course is to make you aware of some of the subconscious parts.<br>
  * For example, you subconsciously understand what other people are trying to say to you.  You cannot hear it, and choose not to understand it, if you know the language.<br>
  * Language is a type of knowledge that converts symbols (visual), sound (auditory), or even feelings (eg. Braille) into concepts and ideas.<br>
  
### What does it mean to "know" a language?
* It means you know a set of building blocks, the blocks being grammar, vocabulary, etc., and how to combine them into more complex structures, in this case ideas.<br>
* You can recognize the blocks and use them <em>unconsciously</em>.<br>
  * Unconscious Knowledge?<br>
    * Consider <em>Expletive Infixation</em><br>
      * Ex. 
        > "I can <strong>guaran-goddamn-tee</strong> you of that."<br>
        > "What a <strong>fan-fuckin'-tastic</strong> day!"<br>
      * You may have never seen the bold words before, but you know very well what they mean, because they are composed of blocks that you know before. <br>
      * Ex.<br>
        > "I've never been to Kalamazoo" <br>
        > "Ka-fuckin'-lamazoo" (Sounds incorrect) <br>
        > "Kala-fuckin-mazoo" (Sounds fine) <br>
        > "Kalama-fuckin'-zoo" (Sounds fine) <br>
      * Ex. <br>
        > "I've never been to Tatamagouche" <br>
        > "ta-fuckin'-tamagouche" (Sounds incorrect) <br>
        > "tata-fuckin'-magouche" (Sounds fine) <br>
        > "tatama-fuckin'-gouche" (Sounds fine) <br>
        > "tatamagou-fuckin'-che" (Sounds incorrect) <br>
      * You were likely never taught to use expletive infixation, yet you know how to use it anyways, and are able to differentiate between words inserted at a normal or weird position.  English native speakers would tend to agree although it was not explicitly taught.<br>
      * Since you are able to judge what sounds correct and what sounds wrong, although you were never taught expletive infixation, it implies that there was some rule that you <em>did</em> know that was working subconsciously.<br>
      
 ## Building Blocks and Rules
 
 ### Phonetics
 
 <strong>Phonetics:</strong> you understand the inventory of sounds in your language.<br>
  * Ex. <br>
    > You know that [b] is an English sound.<br>
    > However, [ñ] is not.<br>
    
 You also instinctively know the shape of peoples' mouths when they make a certain sound.  This is known as the <strong>McGurk Effect</strong>.<br>
 
 ### Phonology 
 
 <strong>Phonology:</strong> Understanding the sound patterns that are possible in your language.
 
 * Ex. <br>
   > There are many English words that begin with [tr]. <br>
   > However, there are no English words that begin with [rt]. <br>
  
Your knowledge of English tells you that [rt] is not possible as a starting sound. (However, other languages may allow [rt] to start a word, such as the Russian word for "Mercury".)<br>

* Ex. <br>
  > How is the plural -s pronounced?  Consider "eels", "caps", "toads", "skunks".<br>
  > In "eels", and "toads", the -s is pronounced as [z], and in "caps", and "skunks", it is pronounced as [s].<br>

Why is it that sometimes that plural -s is pronounced as [z] and sometimes [s]?  You just know because you are familiar with the sounds of the language.<br>

<strong>The Wug Test:</strong>
 * Children as young as two years old were asked to pluralize made-up words and make made-up verbs past tense.<br>
 * The goal of this test was to prove that native speakers subconsciously know how to change word forms and did not just memorize a bank of words.<br>

### Morphology
  
<strong>Morphology:</strong> is the knowledge of word structure. <br>
  * You know a variety of words in your language.<br>
  * You know potential words in your language.<br>
  * You know how to form more complex words from less complex ones.<br>

### Lexicon

<strong>Lexicon:</strong> your mental dictionary of the words you know.
* Words such as: <em>brown, cow, speak, fast, insipid, nefarious, prevaricate, etc.</em>

Your lexicon lets you build more complex words:
* <em>She talks / is talking / talked</em><br>
* <em>differ, differ<strong>ent</strong>, differ<strong>entiate</strong>, differ<strong>entiation</strong>, differ<strong>entiational</strong></em><br>

You know there are constraints on how a word can be build:<br>
* Continuing the previous example, you know that "<em>differ<strong>iatent</strong></em>" is not an English word.<br>

### Complex Word Structures

Your knowledge of language allows you to build <strong>complex word structures:</strong><br>
<em>"Hey, did they change the <strong>failed password security question answer attempts limit</strong>?"</em><br>
<em>"Ministers mull <strong>volcano ash cloud light chaos measures</strong>."</em><br> 
<em>"I just got an <strong>airbag malfunction safety recall follow-up notice</strong>."</em><br> 

### New Words

You can also create new words based on other smaller words you know.  <br>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/211766236-e126d5cb-a2e2-4859-9b16-23ec32e498bc.png)<br>
For example, "blobfish".<br>

Other examples of derivations include "Shopaholic", a person who really likes shopping, and it is derived from "alcoholic". <br>
* "Alcoholic" can be meaningfully broken down into "alcohol" + "-ic". <br>
* However, "Shopaholic" inherits "-aholic" rather than "-ic".  This is interesting because "-aholic" does not mean anything by itself. <br>
* The same goes with "Chocoholic", and "Workaholic" <br>
* Native speakers just know that it sounds more correct to say "Shopaholic" rather than "Shopic". <br>

### Syntax

Part of your knowledge of language is <strong>Syntax</strong>, or phrase and sentence structure.<br>
* You know subconsciously that the word should be "Shopaholic", and not "Shopic".<br>
* Also as a part of syntax, you know when words are place in the correct or incorrect order.<br>
  * Ex.<br>
    > "A white dog" is correct, while "A dog white" is not.<br>
    > "A large manatee" is correct, while "A manatee large" is not.<br>
  
  In English, the adjective typically follows the noun.  However, there are some exceptions.<br>
  * Ex.<br>
    > "All of the <strong>visible</strong> stars are really solar systems.<br>
    > "All of the stars <strong>visible</strong> are really solar systems.<br>
    
    In the example above, both ways are correct.  However, consider the following:<br>
  * Ex.<br>
    > "All of the <strong>new</strong> stars are really solar systems.<br>
    > "All of the stars <strong>new</strong> are really solar systems.<br>
    
    In this example, only the first is correct.<br>
    
  How do we know which adjectives can follow nouns, and which must come after?  This is also a subconscious knowledge native speakers have. <br>

  The same goes with thich order adjectives are presented in:<br>
  * Ex.<br>
    > "Two big white cows"<br>
    > "Big two white cows"<br>
    > "White two big cows"<br>
    > "Cows two big white"<br>
    
  Only the first option is correct for English.  For different languages, the order may be different.<br>
  
  The order of noun phrases also matter:<br>
  *Ex.<br>
    > A: "Did you order new videos?"<br>
    > B: "Yes, I picked <strong>the videos up</strong> at Borders.<br>
    > C: "Yes, I picked <strong>them up</strong> at Borders.<br>
    > B': "Yes, I picked <strong>up the videos</strong> at Borders.<br><br>
    > C': "Yes, I picked <strong>up them</strong> at Borders.<br>
    
  In this example, B' is also a valid response.  However, C' is not.  The difference is the type of noun phrase.  "Videos" is a regular noun phrase, thus B and B' are valid.  However, "them" is a pronoun, not a regular noun phrase.  Thus, C works but C' does not. <br>
  No one may have taught you the information, yet you know it anyways, just due to exposure to the language.<br>
    
### Semantics

<strong>Semantics:</strong> you know how to assign meaning to words in a given sentence.<br>

Consider the following two sentences:<br>
  > "The bear <strong>promised</strong> the monkeys to dance.<br>
  > "The bear <strong>persuaded</strong> the monkeys to dance.<br>
  
In each of the sentences, is the bear or the monkeys dancing?  It can be assumed in the first sentence, the bear dances, while in the second, the monkeys dance.<br>
The only difference between the sentences is the verb, but your intuition tells you which party dances. <br>

### Meanings of Words and Phrases

You know the meanings of many thousands of individual words.  But is that enough?

Consider:
  > "Tom has egg on his face."
  
In this case, the sentence can literally mean that Tom has egg on his face, or it can also mean that Tom is very embarrassed.<br>
Intuition of the hidden meaning is gained from experience using the language, but becomes an unconscious thought after exposure. <br>

## What is NOT Knowledge of Language?

### Reading and Writing
What if a person cannot read or write their language, or any language at all? <br>
* From a linguistic standpoint, <strong>nothing changes</strong>.<br>
* Out of the 6000-7000 living languages, only 3900 have writing systems. The remaining 3200 are unwritten.<br>
* In fact, for most of human history, most people could not read or write.  Writing is parasitic to spoken language. <br>

### Word History
* Native speakers of a language may know nothing about the history of their language, or its relation to other languages. <br>
* They may also know nothing about the history of individual words in their language. <br>
* Even though you may not know the history of certain words, you are still able to use them, thus they are not knowledge of a language. <br>

### Education
* Being a fully competent native speaker of a language is independent of educational level. <br>
* Being more (or less) educated does not make a person a "better" (or "worse") native speaker. <br>

## Linguistic Knowledge

There are two types of Linguistic Knowledge:
1. <strong>Linguistic Competence:</strong> <br>
  * What you know in your mind.<br>
  * What you <em>can</em> do. <br>
  * Systematic knowledge of the building blocks. <br>
2. <strong>Linguistic Performance</strong> <br>
  * What you actually <em>do</em>.<br>
  * What actually comes out of your mouth. <br>
  * Subject to physical limitations. (Breath, fatigue, nerves, etc.)<br>
  
Linguistic competence does not necessarily match linguistic performance.  For example, cases of speech error from jumbling up words.  
> "Don't you fake your shinger at me." <br>

  Target: "Don't you shake your finger at me."<br>
  
> "We're not the only ones with screw looses."<br>

  Target: "We're not the only ones with screws loose."<br>

## Features of Language
There is a set of properties that all human languages share.<br>
* Although all languages are different, they all have their similarities, just how like there are hundreds of different breeds of dogs, but they all have similar bone structure.<br>
* All languages have:<br>
  * <strong>Arbitrariness:</strong> the form and meaning in a language.<br>
    * The relationship between a word and its meaning is arbitrary <br>
    * Shakespeare - “What’s in a name? That which we call a rose / By any other word would smell as sweet”<br>
    * This is why different sounds are used to name the same object across languages <br>
    * True for spoken and sign language.<br>

  * <strong>Creativity:</strong> <br>
    * Speakers use a finite set of building blocks and rules to create and understand an infinite set of novel sentences <br>
    * Sentences cannot simply be memorized or learned by imitation <br>
    * Children are highly productive in their use of language <br>
    * They can create sentences that are not in adult language.  <br>
      > Ex. “Who do you think who’s in that box?”<br>
    * There is no limit on how long a sentence can be.<br>
    * It may be harder to understand if it is wordy, but it is theoretically possible to make a sentence extremely long. <br>
    * Creativity is a universal part of human language.  As Linguist Noam Chomsky emphasized, people must be able to understand and produce unique sentences without effort.<br>

## Language Universals 
* <strong>Universal Grammar (UG)</strong><br>
 * The set of universal properties possessed by all languages <br>
 * Thought of as a set of language "laws"<br>

## Properties of universal grammar
* How do languages differ? <br>
* What do all languages have in common?<br>
  * They all have a lexicon, phonetic system, phonology, morphology, syntactic structure, and semantics <br>
  * True for spoken and signed languages <br>
  * Certain Properties: <br>
     1. Ways of forming questions <br>
     2. Means for negating an utterance <br>
     3. Means for indicating when an action takes place <br>
     4. Possess a set of discrete sounds (or gestures) <br>
     5. Every language is different, but they all share similarities.<br>
  
## Development of Grammar
* All children:<br>
  * acquire the language of their environment <br>
  * acquire language spontaneously <br>
  * exhibit 'linguistic creativity' <br>
  * pass through similar stages as they build their own grammar <br>
* Stages of language development:<br>
  1. Babbling <br>
  2. Babbling in specific language sounds <br>
  3. Single word utterances <br>
  4. Two word utterances <br>
  5. Overgeneralizations<br>
     > “I holded the rabbits”<br>
  6. Fully acquired by age 5 <br>

## Two Kinds of Grammar:

### Descriptive:
 * The Linguist's description or model of the mental grammar.<br>
 * What speaker's rules actually are <br>
   * Speaker's grammar <br>
   * Linguist's grammar<br>

<em>Descriptive grammar is essentially the way native speakers speak.</em><br>
 > “I ain’t seen Bill”<br>
 > “That’s something I can’t deal with”<br>

### Prescriptive:
 * Rules of grammar (for English, often based on latin) used by teachers <br>
 * What speaker's rules should be.<br>
 * <strong>Prescriptive rules</strong> are those that are created, not as a part of grammar, but instead just began when people started using them.  They do not necessarily need to be followed to have grammatical sentences.<br>
   * <strong>Double Negatives</strong><br>
     > "I don't know anybody."  (Standard English)<br>
     > "I don't know nobody."  (Nonstandard English, double negative)<br>
     > "I don't have any idea." (Standard English)<br>
     > "I ain't got no idea." (Nonstandard English, double negative)<br>
  
     * In some languages (such as French), double negatives are used frequently and they don’t cancel.<br>
     * In English, the logic that they should cancel is not followed, simply due to how the language developed.<br>
   
   * <strong>Stranded Prepositions</strong><br>
      * This is a rule native English speakers commonly "break."<br>
        > "Where's the party at?"<br>
        > "That's the mechanic that I talked to."<br>
        > "What did you buy this for?"<br>
      * Based on prescriptive grammar, you cannot end sentences with prepositions.<br>
      * This rule was invented in 1672 by John Dryden, an essayist, while criticizing Ben Jonson's writing. <br>

 <strong>In many cases, prescriptive grammar does not align with descriptive grammar.</strong><br>
 These examples below are acceptable in descriptive grammar, but incorrect in prescriptive grammar.<br>
   > "He don't like it."<br>
   > "He doesn't like nothing."<br>
   > "She is taller than me."<br>
   > "You and me have been invited to a wedding."<br>
   
 These below are unacceptable as descriptive grammar:<br>
 
   > "He it like don't."<br>
   > "Woman the ground on fell."<br>
   
 Also, to follow some of the rules of prescriptive grammar, the sentence would become ungrammatical.<br>
 Consider the following example:<br>
   > The teacher egged on the students.<br>
   > Who did the teacher egg <strong>on</strong>?<br>
 
 The alternative to "fix" the second sentence would be:<br>
   > On <strong>who(m)</strong> did the teacher egg?<br>
 
 This alternative is considered to be ungrammatical by native English speakers.<br>
  
# Summary
When you know language, you know... <br>

Language is subconscious and automatic.<br>
* <strong>Phonetics</strong> (sounds)<br>
* <strong>Phonology</strong> (how sounds interact)<br>
* <strong>Morphology</strong> (word structure)<br>
* <strong>Syntax</strong> (sentence structure)<br>
* <strong>Semantics</strong> (how to interpret words and sentences)<br>
* Different kinds of <strong>linguistic knowledge</strong> (competence, performance)<br>

There are some universal properties of human language.<br>
* <strong>Arbitrariness</strong> - the relationship between a word and its meaning is arbitrary<br>
* <strong>Creativity</strong> - speakers can create an infinite number of different sentences, and others can understand them<br>

Languages are structured by <strong>universal grammar</strong> (UG).<br>
* <strong>Prescriptive grammar</strong> (What people <em>should</em> say)<br>
* <strong>Descriptive grammar</strong> (What people <em>actually</em> say)<br>
