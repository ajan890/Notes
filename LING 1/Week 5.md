# Week 5
## Morphology
**Morphology** is the study of words:
* Their structure, function, and distribution.
* Although morphology is the study of "words", it is surprisingly difficult to figure out what is a word.
* The ultimate goal is to understand how words are represented in the mind of the speaker

### Knowledge of Words
* <strong>Linguistic Creativity</strong><br>
  > "Utah is trying to out-Texas Texas"<br>
  > "I should have been sad when my flashlight batteries died, but I was delighed"<br>
  > "His death was not murder but just a sentence which was all that I had ever wanted to write"<br>
* What do we know when we know a word?
  - The arbitrary sounds associated with a word.
  - The word's meaning
  - The word's syntatic category (noun, verb, adjective, adver, etc)
  - How to use the word in a sentence:
    - Teeth (noun), teethe (verb)
    - Record (noun), record (verb)
  - Syntatic categories will be important when we talk about word and sentence formation (syntax)
* What do we know know when we know a word?:

  - We may or may not know how a word is written
  - We may or may not know a word's etymology, as in the case of tsunami or clue

### Mental Dictionary/Lexicon

Nevertheless, we still know a lot of information about a vast number of words.

- Our own personal store of word is called a **lexicon** , or a "mental dictionary"
- Every word we know has a **lexical entry**
- Your "mental dictionary" includes all the words you know, and all the information associated with them.

How does our mental dictionary differ from printed dictionaries?

- Printed dictionaries include many words that most speakers don't know:
  > Eleemosynary<br>
  > Abomasum<br>
  > Panglossian<br>
  > Tonsure<br>
  > Inchoate<br>
  > Ultracrepidarian<br>
  > Claque<br>
  > Funambulist<br>
- Printed dictionaries do not include many words that speakers actually use regularly - for a history of reasons
- Why are some of these words not in the dictionary (yet)?
  > Ginormous<br>
  > W00t<br>
  > Friend (verb)<br>
  > Facebook (noun, verb)<br>
  > Mankini<br>

- Cling on = stick to (something)
- Klingon = warlike extraterrestrial: (from movie)

## Morphemes

<strong>Morpheme:</strong>

- The smallest lignuistic unit that has meaning
- A morpheme is not equivalent to a word
- However, all words consist of at least one morpheme.
- Discreteness of language:
- Each morpheme is a discrete unit of meaning, which we can manipulate
- We can combine morphines to build new words:
  - Member + ship = membership
  - Lock + able = lockable
- We can decompose words into their morphemes:
  - Sooner = soon + er
  - Morphology = morph + ology

### Types of Morphemes:

![7_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/218307152-ffec7ee8-6820-497b-8210-919c7b346b1a.png)<br>

#### Free morphemes:
* Two types of Free morphemes: **Lexical** and **Functional**
- Can stand alone as complete word
- Examples: fast, to, the, chimney, blue, see, sell, he
- There are two types: Content/lexical and functional
- Content/lexical morphemes have a lexical meaning
- Most nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are content words:

#### Bound morpemes:
- Most be attached to a free morpheme.
  - Examples:
    > -ed (walked-ed)<br>
    > Ing (walk-ing)<br>
    > -s (walk-s)<br>
    > pre-(pre-test)<br>
    > Re- (re-read)<br>
    > Un- (un-do)<br>
* Two types of bound morphemes: **Inflectional** and **Derivational**
![](RackMultipart20230212-1-ctak1m_html_5f59568058f6acfa.png)

#### Lexical Morphemes
- Lexical morphemes are an open class: we can and do create new content words all the time.
- What new words have you come across recently?
  > "jank(y)" - of poor quality<br>
  > "googleganger" - a person similar to one found on Google<br>
  > "dingus" - an idiot<br>
  > "wacky tobacky" - marijuana<br>
  > "Twitterrhea" - excessive use of Twitter<br>

#### Functional morphemes
- Functional morpemes serve some grammatical purpose
- Functional morpgemes include things like pronouns,articles, and conjunctions
  - He, she, it, the, a, and, or
- We call these closed classes; we cannot usually create new words or morphemes in them
- Have you ever heard anyone make up a new pronoun? Preposition?

#### Lexical vs functional

- **Broca's Aphasia** results from damage to Broca's Area in the left hemisphere
- Broca's aphasia patents leave many functional morphmes out of their speech, but still include lexical morphemes
- Broca's aphasia selectively affects only functional morphemes, leaving lexical morphemes unaffected
- This shows the distinction between functional and lexical morhpemes is not purely academic

#### Prefixes and suffixes:

* The morhpemes below are not acceptable words of English:
  > Un-, -ish, -tion
* These are bound morphemes; they cannot stand alone 
  * More examples:
    > **re**align<br>
    > activa**tion**<br>
    > slow**ly**<br>
    > **un**do<br>
    > **dis**member<br>
    > **en**throne<br>
    > giraffe**s**<br>
    > quilt**ed**<br>
    > lambast**ing**<br>  

* The bound morphemes above have been affixed to a root
* In English, we have prefixes and suffices; there are two types of affixes

#### Inflectional vs. Derivational

* **Inflectional morphemes** are grammatical, in that they affect the grammar of the word they attach to
  * Inflectional morphmees do not typical change a word's category.
  * Eight English inflectional morphemes to remember:
    > -s (3rd person singular present)<br>
    > -s (plural)<br>
    > -s (possessive)<br>
    > -ed (past tense)<br>
    > -ing (progressive)<br>
    > -en/ed (past participle)<br>
    > -er (comparitive)<br>
    > -est (superlative)<br>

* Bound infletional morphemes attach to a particular category of word.
- You can (usually) add them to almost every word of the particular category they affix to.
  - **-ing** attaches to regular verbs:
    - Eating, watching, running, texting, being, laughing
  - **Possessive -s** attaches to nouns:
    - Dog's cat's john's houses's
- Inflectional morphmemes "refine" meaning - they add a tiny bit of information, but don't change the core meaning
  - walk to walk**ed** (adds info about whe, but doesn't change action)
  - chair to chairs (adds info about quantity, but core item remains the same)

* **Derivational morphemes** help to **derive** new word categories
  - Adding a derivational morpheme to a word often changed both the word's meaning and "part of speech"
  - In english there are many derivational morphemes. Examples:
    > -ly<br>
    > post-<br>
    > -tion<br>
    > -ish<br>
    > inter-<br>
    > re-<br>
    > pre-<br>
    > trans-<br>
    > de-<br>
* Bound derivational morphemes are usually not as productive as inflectional morphemes.
* Compare:
  * Derivational to Inflectional:
  > "**re**run" to "run**s**"<br>
  > \* "**re**talk" to "talk**s**"<br>
  > "**re**create" to "create**s**"<br>
  > "**re**think" to "think**s**"<br>
  > \* "**re**shut down" to "shut**s** down"<br>

### Combining Morphemes
- We can (and do) transform words into something else all the time, but we know what is okay and what is not:
- Okay:
  > Uneaten<br>
  > Unadmired<br>
  > Ungrammatical<br>
- Not okay
  > Eatenun<br>
  > Admiredun<br>
  > Grammaticalun<br>
* This knowledge allows us to create and understand novel words
- Words have structure, and morphemes are the building blocks
  > Mississippilessy<br>
  > Mississippi + less + ly<br>
- Morphemes are usually put together in a specific order:
  > Desirability vs desirityable<br>
  > Desire + able + ity vs desire + ity + able<br>
- Antidisestablishmentatrianism
  > anti + dis + establish + ment+ arian + ism<br>
  > \* anti + establish + dis + arian + ment + ism<br>

#### Affixes combining

- Certain affixes attach to certain kinds of words:
  - **-able:**
  > Loveable<br>
  > Workable<br>
  > Doable<br>
  > \*catable<br>
  > \*blueable<br>
- What does the affix -able combine with?
  - It only attaches to verbs

- **-ish:**
  > Reddish<br>
  > Bookish<br>
  > \*helpish<br>
  > \*lovish<br>
  > \*walkish<br>

#### Morphology problem

- Suffix **-ly** problem in English:
  > Simply, rarely, cautiously, bitterly, completely, grandly
- What category do all these words belong to?
  - They are adverbs.
- Notice that we can write a straightforward "rule" to account for its behavoir:
  - Adjective + -ly = adverb

### Word Formation
* More morphemes:
  > Rewrite = re + write<br>
  > Boy = boy<br>
  > Boyish = boy + ish<br>
  > Boyishness = boy + ish + ness<br>

* Another way to visualize this with brackets:

  > Rewrite = [re[write]]<br>
  > Boy = [boy]<br>
  > Boyish = [[boy]ish]<br>
  > Boyishness = [[[boy]ish]ness]<br>

## Word trees

* Another way to visualize this is word trees:

![24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/218307450-71c3cf3d-4c73-4dd3-ae10-21f85c27d875.png)<br>

* Word trees create a roadmap of how to build a word.

- Morpehemes can only combine in a particular order, and only with specific categories of other morphemes.
- Trees help show these ordered relationships of the morphemes within a word.

- Unfinished = un-finished
  - \*unfinish-ed

* Compare:
  - Rider, colder, silver, smoker
  - How many morphemes does each word have?
  - Rid + er (agent), cold + er (comparative, silver(root), smok+ er(agent)

![26_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/218307755-3a965cd3-b6bc-4648-bc47-282dbc646130.png)<br>
![27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/218307764-39d45d8e-63ab-44c9-b7bf-33943a110b03.png)<br>
![27+](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/218307766-a17102a6-c787-446b-833b-317ee2fe67e8.png)<br>

* Beware of **ambiguous words!**
- What are the two interpretations of the word unlockable?
  - Unlockable = incapable of being locked
  - Unlockable = capable of being unlocked

![28_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/218307842-bcfea9d8-d5c9-41ac-8a59-782e1997ae0a.png)<br>

### Ambiguous Structures

![29_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/218307870-9df642b7-eec0-42bb-8fad-cba3b168c874.png)<br>

* Fish or bok choy
* A fin or a leaf?

#### Affixiation
- Affixiation is one process we use to build new words
- We can adapt the meaning of a word by piling more affixes onto it.
* Affix:
  - Any morepheme that attacehs to a root (bound morpheme)
  - We already know about some kinda of affixiation
* <strong>Prefixes:</strong>
- Affixes that attach before the root. (pre-history, im-possible)
  - (pre-history, im-possible)
* <strong>Suffixes:</strong>
- Affixes that attach after the root
  - (fix-able, finish-ed)
- Does English have a causitive morpheme?

#### English Causatives:
- Multiple ways to produce English causative:
  > "I will black-en the shirt"<br>
  > "I will make the shirt black"<br>
- English has a causative suffix -en that attaches to some adjectives
- This is a derivational suffix, because it changes the category of the word
- But it's of limited productivity:
  > \*"I will purple-en the shirt"<br>

#### New Bound Morpheme in English?

![34_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/218307960-c1e6da80-3ea0-4229-ae90-2d10d13c4152.png)<br>

* American English has developed a new "intensifier" -ass
  - Which is somewhat vulgar and colloquial:
  > "That is a big-ass chimichanga" = "that is a very big chimichanga"<br>
  > "It's a cold-ass night" = "It is a very cold night"<br>
  > "This is a hard ass exam" = "This is a very hard exam"<br>
  - Native speakers know intensive -ass is a boung morpheme
    > Question: "are you cold?"<br>
    > Answer: "very"<br>
    > Answer: "\*Ass"<br>
- This suffix has subtle properties that native speakers know
- "He is a very ignorant man" = "He is an ignorant-ass man"

### Infixes:
- An affix that attaches inside the root.
  > "Abso-goddamned-lutely!"<br>
  > "In-fuckin'-credible"<br>
- "Iz" infixiation:
  > House = h-iz-ouse"<br>
  > Shit = sh-iz-nit<br>
- "Homeric" infixation (homer simpson)
  > Education = edu-ma-cation<br>
  > Saxophone = saxo-ma-phone<br>

### Circumfix:
* Affixes that surrounded the root both initially and finally.

* <strong>German:</strong>
  > "lieb" = <em>love</em><br>
  > "**ge** + lieb + **t**" = <em>loved</em> (past participle)<br>

* **Chickasaw** (Oklahoma)
  > "chokma" = <em>he is good</em><br>
  > "**ik**chokm**o**" = <em>he isn't good</em><br>
  > "palli" = <em>is it hot</em> = "**ik**pall**o** = <em>it isn't hot</em><br>
  > "lakna" = <em>is it yellow</em> = "**ik**lakn**o** = <em>it isn't yellow</em><br>

* What two elements are associated with the negative morpheme in Chickasaw?
  > **ik-** and **-o**<br>

## Morphological Analysis
* Looking for recurring morphemes.
* Compare and contrast partially similar forms.
* Look at the meanings for consistently meaningful forms

### Case Study: Kanuri
<strong>Kanuri:</strong> a chadic language of Nigeria<br>
> Karate = excellent<br>
> Nәmkarte = excellence<br>
> Kura = big<br>
> Nәmkura = bigness<br>
> Guna = small<br>
> Nәmgana = smallness<br>
From this information, we can make some inferences:<br>
* What part of speech is excellent = Adjective
* What part of speech is excellence = Noun
* What is the morphine is Januri which can be used to derive nouns from adjectives
  * Nәm-
* If the word for length is nәmkurugu, then what is the word for long?
  * Kurugu

### Case Study: Chickasaw (Native American Language)
> Sachaaha = I am tall<br>
> Chaaha = he is tall<br>
> Chichaaha = you are tall<br>
> Hoochaaha = they are tall<br>
> Satikahbi = I am tired<br>
> Chitikahbitok = you were tired<br>
> Chichokwa = you are cold (ass)<br>
> Hopobatok = he was hungry<br>
> Hoohopobatok = they were hungry<br>
> Sahopoba = I am hungry<br>
Same as above:
* -chaaha = to be tall
* Sa- = I
* -tikahbi = to be tired
* Chi- = you
* -chokwa = to be cold (to be ass)
* -hopoba- = to be hungry
* Hoo- = they<br>
Note: The <strong>absence</strong> of an affix can be significant:<br>
* Use the symbol {\null set symbol} to show an unmarked morpheme
* The morpheme which means “he” in Chickasaw is {the null set symbol}
* Example:
  * -tok marks past tense
  * ∅ (absence of other morphemes) marks present tense<br>
From this information, we can also make inferences on how to say sentences that were not given.<br>
> “He is cold.” = Chokwa
> “I was cold” = Sachokwatok

## Allomorphy
### The English Plural Morpheme
* How do we pluraize regular nouns in English?<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/219984601-127ca146-5038-4c97-bdf5-f9eed761d81d.png)<br>
* [s], [z], and [ɪz] are allomorphs of the plural morpheme, written as -s (or -es)
* If the plural -s is realized in 3 different ways, then how do we know which one to use?

### Wug Test
<strong>Study by Jean Berko Gleason, 1958</strong>
> Experimenter: “This is a wug.  Now there are two of them. Now there are two..."<br>
> Child: "wug[z]!"<br>
> Experimenter: “Two days ago I had only one shola, but yesterday I bought another one. Now I have two..."<br>
> Child: "shola[z]!”<br>
* etc.<br>
* You know how to pluralize novel words
* Although the plural -s can be realized in three different ways, you have clear intuitions about when to use each realization.
* This is part of your knowledge of morphology.

### Plurals
* The behavior of the plural -s is predictable
* We can predict which of the three forms will appear in any given phonetic environment.
* Let’s look at our list of plurals to see if we can identify the relevant environment;<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/219984798-818c4af9-db96-45fb-851e-2cadc196d283.png)<br>
* First, list the actual sounds that [z], [s], [ɪz] appear after:
  * [-z] appears after [b], [g], [n], [d]
  * [-s] appears after [t], [k], [f], [p]
  * [-ɪz] appears after [ʃ], [z], [tʃ], [dʒ]
* Next determining what each group of sounds has in common:<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/219984843-0fb0fec1-4ce0-4c23-b922-24572154572d.png)<br>
* The sounds [z], [ʃ], [tʃ], [dʒ] belong to a special class of sounds called sibilants (also includes [s] and [ʒ])
* Sibilants are sounds that have a buzzing, hissy quality.
* [-ɪz] appears after:<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/219984866-dc110585-bd1a-4557-9fca-73fe0066ca30.png)<br>
* We can represent it like this:<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/219984886-b62019d5-ef24-41e5-8189-282d372bfd95.png)<br>

### Inflection
* Inflection morphemes are purely grammatical - they mark tense, number, gender, case, etc.
* They are often very productive
* Inflectional morphemes typically come after derivational morphemes in a word.<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/219984924-7b4e6e29-2d45-4fc4-883c-66b2a71fe3e6.png)<br>
* Inflectional morphemes can perform a great number of functions
* English is an inflection poor language; it uses a limited set of eight inflection morphemes
* Some languages make greater use of inflectional morphemes
* Many languages (german and russian) have paradigms that mark “case”

### Case Marking
* Nouns have a particular form depending on their category (subject, object, etc)
<strong>In Russian:</strong><br>
> Victor+a = “Victor’s”<br>
> Victor+u = “to Victor”<br>
> Victor+om = “by Victor”<br>
> Victor+ye = “about Victor”<br>

<strong>In English:</strong><br>
> I love them<br>
> They love me<br>

### Word Formation
* There are many word formation strategies found in the world’s languages
  * Affixiation
  * Prefixiation
  * Suffixiation
  * Infixiation
  * Circumfixiation

### Reduplication
* Forming new words by duplicating part or all of an existing word.
* Partial reduplication (tagalog):
  * “Bili” = buy
  * “Bibili” = will buy
  * “Pasok” = enter
  * “Papasok” = will enter
* Total reduplication (Indonesian)
  * “Rumah” = house
  * “rumahrumah” = houses
  * “”Ibu” = mother
  * “Ibuibu” = mothers
* **Reduplication in English**
  * English does use reduplication
* Contrastive Focus reduplication (CF reduplication)
  > “I’ll make the tuna salad and you make the salad-salad”<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/219986019-9a363052-9f94-46ff-bfc4-a26eac90f697.png)<br>
  > “Oh we’re not living together-living together”<br>
  > “We call him “psycho Marcus” in order to distinguish him from normal Marcus and Marcus-Marcus.”<br>
  > “I talked to him last week, but I didn’t talk to him-talk to him”<br>
* Contrastive Focus Reduplication in English puts focus on the most prototypical, stereotypical example of something.
  * “You make the salad-salad” = “you make the real/normal salad.”
  * “Should I wear a hat-hat?”
    * As opposed to a yarmulke
  * “Charley is no more like a dog-dog than he is like a cat” (John Steinbeck, “travels with Charley” 1962)
    > Person A: “Are you nervous?”<br>
    > Person B: “Yeah but you know, not nervous-nervous” (as in not “really” nervous)<br>
* This kind of focusing reduplication is found in a number of other languages:
* <strong>Spanish:</strong>
  * "No es una <strong>casa</strong>-casa." = “this isn’t a real house” (Women on the Verge of  Nervous Breakdown, Pedro Almodovar, 1993)
* <strong>Russian:</strong>
  * “On <strong>zheltyj</strong>-zheltyj, a ne limonno-zheltyj.”
  * "It’s <strong>yellow</strong>-yellow but not lemon-yellow.”

#### Constraints on Reduplication in English
* There are grammatical constraints on CS Reduplication.  Consider these examples:
  > “He is out-of-his-mind-out-of-his-mind” (correct)<br>
  > \*”He is out-out-of-his-mind.” (ungrammatical)<br>
  > \*”He is out-of-his-mind-mind” (ungrammatical)<br>

  > “They are sleeping together, but they’re not sleeping together-sleeping together.” (correct)<br>
  > \*”they’re sleeping together, but they’re not sleeping together-together.” (ungrammatical)<br>
  
  > “Do I like you-like you?” No. You’re a little too neurotic for me.” (correct)<br>
  > \*”Do I like Tom-like Tom? He’s a little too neurotic for me.” (ungrammatical)<br>
  > “Do I like-like Tom? No. He’s a little too neurotic for me.” (correct)<br>

  > “I wouldn’t date-date a linguist” (correct)<br>

### Singlish Morphology
* Let’s take a look at the use of reduplication in other non-standard varieties of English.
* Native English dialect found in Singapore.
* Singapore is located on the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula.
* Singlish is a colloquial variety of English
* It makes extensive use of reduplication
* Singlish allows for reduplication of nouns, adjectives and verbs
* Look at the following from Spanish.
* Noun Reduplication:
  > “Where is your boy-boy?” (Boyfriend, son)<br>
  > “Sawy who told you mummy-mummy is a graduate” (Dear mom)<br>
  > “I’m looking for Ry-Ry” (dear Henry)<br>
  > Jeff-Jeff, come and see this. (Jeffrey sweetheart)<br>
  > Su-Su, come-here (suzie, a dog)<br>
* What meaning is associated with nominal reduplication?
  * Nominal reduplication adds intimacy.

#### Noun Reduplication
* Nominal reduplication is constrained:
  * Ry-ry but not *Henry-Henry
  * Jeff-Jeff but not *Jeffrey-Jeffrey
  * Su-Su but not *suzie-suzie
* When a proper name is reduplication in Singlish, what is constraint?
* Keep in mind: buddy-buddy (close male friend)
* The proper name must have only one syllable
* This rule does not apply to common nouns!

#### Adjectival Reduplication
* Look at the Singlish forms below:
  * Adjectival reduplication:
  * Don’t always eat sweet-sweet things. (very sweet)
  * Make it smaller-smaller.
* Come and see the lizard’s tail; black-clack one. (very black)
* Plain adjectives and comparative can be reduplicated.
* But superlative adjectives can not be reduplicated:
  > \*"Make it smallest-smallest" (ungrammatical)

#### Verb Reduplicaton
* <strong>Data set 1:</strong>
  > “Let her be. She cry-cry” (cry a little bit)<br>
  > “I cough-cough then no more already” (minor coughing)<br>
  > “No traffic polic…stop-stop a while” (Make a short stop)<br>
* <strong>Data set 2:</strong>
  > “Why you cough-cough-cough whole day long?” (keep coughing)<br>
  > “I walk-walk-walk, then I fall down.” (In the act of walking)<br>
  > “They choose-choose so long already.” (In the act of choosing)<br>
* What is the difference in meaning between reduplicating once and twice?
  * Reduplicating once or twice indicates how much an action is repeated.
