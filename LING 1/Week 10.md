# Week 10
## Language and Thought
### Introduction
* Does **language = thought**?
* Is language equivalent to thought?
* Does language determine thought?

---

* Is language a direct mirror of thought?
* English:
  > "the dog chased the cat"<br>
  * Subject, verb, object
* Korean:
  > "kega koya≈ãilil c'chgatta"<br>
  * Subject, object, verb
* Tagalog:
  > "hinabol ng aso ang pusa"<br>
  * Verb, subject, object
* Malagasy
  > "nanaraha ny saka ny alika"<br>
  * Verb, object, subject

* Do differences between these languages indicate that the speakers somehow think about events differently?
  * Could it be that Tagalog and Malagasy focus on the action the most?
  * Could it be that Korean focuses on the relationship between the objects?

### Is Language Equal To Thought - Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis?
* Edward Sapir (1884 - 1939)
  * Influential linguist and anthropologist
  * Different languages classify experiences differently, completely, and incommensurably.
  * The same experience will be encoded differently in different languages
* Benjamin Lee Whorf (1897 - 1941)
  * Fire prevention engineer
  * Worked his day job at the Hartford Fire Insurance Company while doing linguistics on the side
  * Self-trained in linguistics
* The two men eventually met.<br>
#### Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis:
* "We cut up and organize the spread and flow of events as we do largely because, through our mother tongue, we are parties to an agreement to do so, not because nature itself is segmented in exactly that way for all to see."<br>
* Structure of a language influences how its speakers perceive the world around them.
* Two forms: strong and weak.
  * Strong form, **linguistic determinism**: The structure of a language **determines** how speakers think
  * Weak form, **linguistic relativism**: Different languages encode different categories, and speakers of different languages think about the world in different ways.
* Speakers of different languages see the world in different, incompatible ways, because their languages impose different conceptual structures on their experiences.
### Evidence:
#### Languages
* **Hopi Language**
  * Native American language Hopi, spoken in Arizona
  * Whorf wrote that Hopi contains "no words, grammatical forms, constructions or expressions that refer directly to what we call "time," or to past, or future, or to enduring or lasting."
  * What are we to make of the following sentence translated from Hopi?
    * Then indeed, the following day, quite early in the morning at the hour when people pray to the sun, around that time then he woke up the girl again."
  * Other detailed studies of Hopi showed that Hopi speech has tense markers, metaphors for time, units of time.  (Days, numbers of days, weeks, months, lunar phases, seasons, and the year)
  * The culture has a horizon-based calendar, exact ceremonial day sequences, knotted calendar strings, notched calendar sticks, and timekeeping devices similar to sundials.
* **Inuit Language**
  * Whorf claimed Inuit language to have several terms for *snow*
    > "Qanuk" = "snowflake"<br>
    > "Qanir" = "to snow"<br>
    > "Qanunge" = "to snow"<br>
    > "Qanugglir" = "to snow"<br>
    > "Kaneq" = "frost"<br>
    > "Kaner" = "be frosty"<br>
    > "Kanevvluk" = "fine snow"<br>
    > "Natquik" = "drifting snow"<br>
    > "Natquigte" = "for snow to drift along the ground"<br>
  * Franz Boas - Father of American Anthropology
    * In 1911, he wrote the Handbook of American Indian languages.
    * Boas reported 4 different roots for "snow" in Inuit language.
  * In an article in 1940, Whorf claimed Inuit to have seven roots for *snow*.
  * This was widely reprinted and cited in textbooks and popular books about language.
  * The estimates of the number of "snow" words kept getting inflated with retelling.
  * However, there are many different Inuit languages and not all possess the same number of terms.
    * This number of terms to describe snow is probably matched or surpassed by skiers, regardless of their language.
  * This implies that there is *specialization.*
#### Specialization
* Different groups within a culture vary in terms of the number of words they use for things.
* Consider some examples:
  * Who can probably name and identify more colors, a housepainter or a linguistics professor?
  * Who can name and identify more organs, a butcher or a surgeon?
  * In these cases, everyone can perceive the same number of colors and organs.  It's just a matter of it can be expressed.
* What about English "snow" words?
  > "snow" = snow<br>
  > "slush" = partially melted snow<br>
  > "sleet" = falling wet snow<br>
  > "blizzard" = snow storm<br>
  > "avalanche" = snow falling from a stationary object, like a mountainside<br>
  > "flurry" = very light snowfall<br>
  > "powder" = light snow on the ground<br>
  > "dusting" = very little snow on the ground<br>
  > "hardpack" = condensed/compressed snow on the ground<br>
  > "snowball," "snowdrift," "snowfall," "snowflake," etc.<br>
* Do English speakers experience snowy environments as a winter wonderland of textures of snow and ice?
#### Mismatches
* Mismatches between language and thought:
* Oftentimes, the **linguistic sense** is **different** from the **intended sense.**
  > They're living on a shoestring."<br>
  > "You're getting under my skin."<br>
  > "He's out to lunch."<br>
#### Ambiguity
* There are ambiguous words like **bat**, **bug**, and **bank**, but the concepts are clearly distinct.
* If language were the same as thought, would it be possible to distinguish the different senses?
#### New Words for New Concepts
* When a language lacks a word or grammatical device to express somthing, speakers make up a new word, invent a metaphor, or borrow words or expressions.  This process would be impossible if language determined thought.
* People invent new concepts and make up new words for them, like Freud with the word **id**.
* What are native English words for **algebra**, **hypotenuse**, **ecology**, etc.? (There aren't any, the words are borrowed.)
  * It's not just scientific terms:
    * **skandha**, **moksha**, **transubstantiation**, etc.
* We can explain a concept without have a word for it.
* This is the entire basis of comedic device "sniglets," which comedian Rich Hall described as "any word that doesn't appear in the dictionary, but should."

#### Case Study - Ildefonso
* There are several reasons to think that concepts of linguistic determinism and linguistic relativity are on the wrong track.
* Let's consider some evidence: adults who lacked language.
* In one case, a man, **Ildefonso**, was born deaf in a Mexican village and came to Los Angeles.
* At 27 years old, he crossed paths with an American Sign Language interpreter, Susan Schaller.
* Even though he lacked language, Ildefonse had jobs.
* He learned to do addition on paper in three minutes.
* Once he started learning ASL, he was able to convey parts of his life story:
  * He grew up desperately poor and begged his parents to send him to school.  (His parents decided not to.)
  * The crops he had picked in different states.
  * How he had evaded immigration authorities.
* Ildefonse led Schaller to other language-less adults
* They handled money, played card games, entertained each other with long pantomimed narratives.
* Even though he lacked language, Ildefonse clearly had thoughts and was able to think rationally.
* **If language really were equal to thought, is this what we would expect to find?** (No!)
#### Thought in Animals
* There are animals that lack language, but clearly they do have thoughts.
#### Experimental Testing of the Theory
* Two major approaches have been employed to test the validity of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.
* **Test the strong view:**
  * Language determines thought by seeing if the cognitive system can make distinctions that are not linguistically represented.
  * Cultural variations in color terms<br?
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/225560028-29744108-9958-40d6-a223-3d9062bdc7c4.png)<br>
  * If your language didn't have separate names for these colors, would you see them the same way?
  * Much of the initial research focused on an aspect of language which varies widely across cultures.
  * **Color Terms:**
    * There are a few languages which have only two color terms, and some with three.
    * Most languages draw their color names from 11 specific colors.
    * **Berlin and Kay, 1969**
      * Studied color hierarchy in 20 languages.
      * Rules:
        * Consist of only one morpheme.
        * Not contained within another color word.
        * Not restricted to a small number of objects.
        * Commonly known
      * In two-color-term languages, the terms always correspond to black and white.
      * In three-color-term languages, they correspond to black, white, and red.
      * Languages with additional terms are add as follows: yellow, green, blue, then brown, then purple, pink, orange, and gray.
      * The color hierarchy data from this study runs contrary to Whorf's hypotheses.
      * It suggests a universal physiological basis for color naming, independent of language.
    * **Hieder (1972) and Rosch (1973)** (same person)
      * **Dani tribe of New Guinea** use only two color names:
        * **Mili** - cool/dark shades (e.g., blue, green, black)
        * **Mola** - warm/light shades (e.g., red, yellow, white)
      * They had no difficulty in recognizing color chips that were from an initial presentation from among distracters, even though they had no names for the colors.
      * Additionally, they were better at recognizing focal colors (e.g., the best example of blue) than non-focal colors (just as we English speakers are).
      * This data does **not** support the strong view of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.
* **Test a weaker view:**
  * Language influences thoughts
  * **Winawer, Boroditsky**, and others (2007)
    * English and Russian divide up blues differently:
    * Russian makes an obligatory distinction between light blue ("**goluboy**") and darker blue ("**siniy**").<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/225563946-6866074b-c56b-4049-a29b-53019392f7f7.png)<br>
    * There is no word that just means "**blue**" in Russian.
    * Russian speakers were presented with various tableaus of three squares on a computer screen: one on top and two right below it.<br>
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/225564227-76b1b848-bbb7-4114-94fd-e450c6665c71.png)<br>
    * They were asked to identify which bottom square matches the top square.
    * Does having different words for light blue and dark blue have any effect on perception?
    * **Results:**
      * There is in fact a difference.
      * Russian speakers were faster to discriminate two colors when they fell into different linguistic categories (one *siniy* and the other *goluboy*) than when they were from the same linguistic category (both *siniy* or both *goluboy*).
      * English speakers tested on the identical stimuli did **not** show an advantage in any of the conditions.
      * How *much* faster were the Russia speakers on average?
        * Around 124 milliseconds!
      * This shows support for weak version of the Whorfian hypothesis: categories in language affect performance on simple perceptual color tasks.
### Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis - Conclusions
* It is apparent that the **strong** view of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, **Linguistic Determinism** is **not** supported.
* Empirical basis of Sapir-Whorf is **incorrect**:
  * Hopi has time words.
  * Not only Inuit has multiple "snow" words etc.
  * Evidence can be seen in:
    * Languageless adults.
    * Primates.
    * Experiments with Dani.
* There is some support for the **weaker** version of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, **Linguistic Relativism.**
  * Russian "blues" study:
    * Data from areas of investigation like color naming indicates that the use of certain specific terms may influence how we think under certain experimental conditions.
    * Steven Pinker (The Language Instinct, 1994)
      * "Most of the experiments have tested banal "weak" versions of the Whorfian hypothesis, namely that words can have some effect on memory or categorization.  Some of these experiments have actually worked, but that is hardly surprising."

# Summary
* Language is language, and thought is thought.
* They are **not equivalent**.
* It seems that there is a deep connection between language and thought, because your own internal dialog can seem like a conversation with yourself.
* When you hear a sentence of your language in your head, does that constitute a thought?
* Thought language has some relation to thought, it is not equal to and does not determine thought.
* In the cases where language influences thought, it only has a minor effect.
