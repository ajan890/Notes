# Week 4
## Phonetics Knowledge Of Language
* When you know the **phonetics** of your language, what do you actually know?<br>
* What is a **phonetic inventory**?<br>
* The phonetic inventory of a language is the set of sounds in the language.<br>
* The phonetic inventory of American English includes subsets of consonants and vowels.<br>
* It does **not** include other types of sounds.<br>
* What do you know when you know the phonetic inventory of a language?<br>
* You know how to separate a continuous stream of speech into distinct words and a word into distinct sounds.<br>
  > **Mother:** "Hold on!"<br>
  > **Child:** "I'm holing don! I'm holing don!"<br>
* We think we pause between distinct words, but we don't.<br>

## Speech Sound Production: The Basics 
### Vocal Tract
* Structures that work together to produce speech sounds.<br>
* The vocal tract is important to the way we label and define consonants and vowels.<br>

* You should be able to identify these parts of the vocal tract:<br>
  > 1. Alveolar ridge<br>
  > 2. Hard palate<br>
  > 3. Soft palate/velum<br>
  > 4. Uvula<br>
  > 5. Pharynx<br>
  > 6. Glottis<br>


### Orthography
* **Phonetics ≠ Spelling**<br>
* **Same symbol, different sound:**<br>
  > <strong>s</strong>kip<br>
  > <strong>h</strong>ouse<br>
  > <strong>c</strong>lip<br>
  > <strong>s</strong>hip<br>
  > g<strong>h</strong>ost<br>
  > i<strong>c</strong>e<br>
  > rai<strong>s</strong>e<br>
  > <strong>h</strong>our<br>
  > ri<strong>c</strong>h<br>
* **Same sound(s), different symbols:**
  > pu<strong>ff</strong>/rou<strong>gh</strong><br>
  > <strong>shun</strong> / emo<strong>tion</strong><br>
  > <strong>jet</strong> / suffra<strong>gette</strong><br>

  > "Did h<strong>e</strong> bel<strong>ie</strong>ve that C<strong>ae</strong>sar would s<strong>ee</strong> the p<strong>eo</strong>ple s<strong>ei</strong>ze the s<strong>ea</strong>s?" <br>
  * <strong>[i]</strong> = e, ie, ae, ee, eo, ei, ea<br>

  > One reason why I cannot spell, <br>
  > Although I learned the rules quite well <br>
  > Is that some words like <em>coup</em> and <em>through </em><br>
  > Sound just like <em>threw</em> and <em>flue</em> and <em>Who</em>; <br>
  > When <em>oo</em> is never spelled the same, <br>
  > The <em>duice</em> becomes a guessing game; <br>
  > And then I ponder over <em>though</em>, <br>
  > Is it spelled <em>so</em>, or <em>throw</em>, or <em>beau</em>, <br>
  > And <em>bough</em> is never <em>bow</em>, it's <em>bow</em>, <br>
  > I mean the <em>bow</em> that sounds like <em>plow</em>, <br>
  > And not the <em>bow</em> that sounds like <em>row</em>- <br>
  > The <em>row</em> that is pronounced like <em>roe</em>. <br>
  > I wonder, too, why <em>rough</em> and <em>tough</em>, <br>
  > That sound the same as <em>gruff</em> and <em>muff</em>, <br>
  > Are spelled like <em>bough</em> and <em>though</em>, for they <br>
  > Are both pronounced a different way.<br>
  > \- Vivian Buchan, NEA Journal 1966/67<br>

* **Symbols which are not pronounced:**
  > i<strong>s</strong>land<br>
  > <strong>o</strong>possum<br>
  > w<strong>h</strong>ere<br>
  > <strong>p</strong>sychology<br>
  > su<strong>b</strong>tle<br>
  > ans<strong>w</strong>er<br>
  > <strong>k</strong>nife<br>
  > <strong>g</strong>nome<br>
  > mak<strong>e</strong><br>

## International Phonetic Alphabet (Ipa) 
### Rules
* One symbol = one sound<br>
* The International Phonetic Alphabet is universal: it can be used to represent any human language.<br>
* IPA symbols are enclosed in square brackets: <br>
  > phone = [fon]  <br>
  > phonetics = [fǝ'nεriks]<br>

## Consonants Vs. Vowels
* Sounds of languages fall into two classes: **consonants** and **vowels**.<br>
* **Consonants:** produced with some closure in the vocal tract that impedes the flow of air from the lungs.<br>
* In phonetics, consonants and vowels are different types of sounds; not just contrasted with  respect to the alphabet.<br>

### Consonants:
* Consonants are distinguished using three features:<br>
  1. Place of Articulation<br>
  2. Manner of Articulation<br>
  3. Voicing<br>

#### Places of Articulation
<strong>Where is the consonant produced?</strong><br>
<strong>Articulation:</strong> part of the mouth (usually the tongue) touches or interacts with another area of the vocal tract.<br>
<strong>There are seven places of articulation.</strong><br>
1. Bilabials<br>
    * Sounds produced by bringing both lips together.  <br>
      > pie, buy, my <br>
      > [p] [b] [m]<br>

2. Labiodentals<br>
    * Sounds produced by touching the bottom lip to the upper teeth.<br>
      > five, view <br>
      > [f] [v]<br>

3. Interdentals:<br>
    * Sounds produced by inserting the tip of the tongue between the upper teeth and the lower teeth.<br>
      > thigh, thus [0] [ð]<br> 


4. Alveolars:<br>
    * Sounds produced by raising the tip of the tongue to the alveolar ridge. (part of the hard palate directly behind the upper front teeth)<br>
      > tie, die, night, sip, zip, light, rock <br>
      > [t] [d] [n] [s] [z] [I] [r]<br>

5. Palatals:<br>
    * Sounds produced by raising the front part of the tongue to the hard palate. (Bony section of the roof of the mouth behind the alveolar ridge)<br>
      > mission, measure, cheap, judge, you <br>
      > [ʃ] [ʒ] [tʃ] [dʒ] [j]<br>



6. Velars:<br>
    * Sounds produced by raising the back of the tongue to the soft palate or velum.<br>
      > back, bag, bang <br>
      > [k] [g] [ŋ]<br>


7. Glottals:<br>
    > high [h], uh-oh [ʔ]<br> 
    * [h] produced with the flow of air through the open glottis.<br>
    * [ʔ] produced if the air is stopped completely at the glottis by tightly closed vocal cords: glottal stop.<br>

8. Labio-velar (i.e., bilabial AND velar): <br>
    * Sounds produced by a combination of pursed lips and raising the back of the tongue to the velum.<br>
      > witch, and which<br>
      > [w] [w]<br>

<strong>Places of Articulation Reivew</strong><br>
* **Bilabials:** **p**ie, **b**uy, **m**y <br>
  > [**p**] [**b**] [**m**] <br>
* **Labiodentals:** **f**ive, **v**iew <br>
  > [**f**] [**v**] <br>
* **Interdentals:** **th**igh, **th**us<br>
  > [**θ**] [**ð**]<br>
* **Alveolars:** **t**ie, **d**ie, **n**ight, **s**ip, **z**ip, **l**ight, **r**ock <br>
  > [**t**] [**d**] [**n**] [**s**] [**z**] [**l**] [**r**]<br>
* **Palatals:** mi**ss**ion, mea**s**ure, **ch**eap, ju**dg**e, **y**ou<br>
  > [**S**] [**ʒ**] [**tʃ**] [**dʒ**] [**j**]<br>
* **Velars:** bac**k**, ba**g**, ba**ng**<br>
  > [**k**] [**g**] [**ŋ**]<br>
* **Glottals:** **h**igh, **u**h-oh<br>
  > [**h**] [**ʔ**]<br>
* **Labio-velars:** **w**itch, and **wh**ich<br>
  > [**w**] [**w**]<br>

<strong>Practice Set</strong><br>
* Identify the initial sound in the words below according to place of articulation.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong><br>
  > "Fight" begins with a labiodental sound.<br>
  > A. "Horse" begins with a glottal sound.<br>
  > B. "Cat" begins with a velar sound.<br>
  > C. "Baby" begins with a bilabial sound.<br>
  > D. "Dog" begins with an alveolar sound.<br>
  > E. "This" begins with an interdental sound.<br>

## Voicing
* Are the vocal folds vibrating (voiced) or not (voiceless-open glottis)?<br>
  > **P**ie vs. **B**uy<br>
  > **T**ie vs. **D**ie<br>
  > **C**ap vs. **G**ap<br>

### Voiceless vs Voiced Sounds
* **Voiceless:** Vocal folds/cords are **apart**, air flows freely through glottis.<br>
**s**u**p**er [supər]<br>
* **Voiced:** Vocal folds/cords are **together**, air forces through, causing vibrations.<br>

<strong>Example:</strong><br>
* [s] and [z] differ only in voicing.<br>
  * [s] is **voiceless**.<br>
  * [z] is **voiced**.<br>

* Put your hand on your throat. <br>
  > sssssssssss zzzzzzzzz sssssssss zzzzzzz<br>
* Notice that your tongue does not change position!<br>
* If you put your hand on your throat while you say these sounds, can you feel the difference between consonants?<br>
  > [p] - pear<br>
  > [p] is **voiceless**<br>

  > [v] - vine<br>
  > [v] is **voiced**<br>

  > [f] - fine<br>
  > [f] is **voiceless**<br>

## Manner Of Articulation
* How is the consonant produced?<br>
* **Stops:** There is a complete obstruction of airflow somewhere in the vocal tract.<br>
* **Oral stops:**<br>
  > [p] [b] [t] [d] [k] [g] [ʔ]<br>
* The velum is raised to block the nasal cavity so that when the stop is released, the air flows out through the mouth.<br>
* Sounds can only be heard when released into a vowel or another sound.<br>

* **Nasal stops:**<br>
  > [m] [n] [n]<br>
* The velum is lowered to open the nasal cavity.<br>


* What feature distinguishes the bold sounds on the left from the ones on the right?<br>
  > cab [kæb] (Oral) vs. cam [kæm] (Nasal)<br>
  > raid [red] (Oral) VS. rain [ren] (Nasal)<br>
  > rug [rɅg] (Oral) VS. rung [rɅŋ] (Nasal)<br>

### Aspiration
* Put your hand in front of your mouth and pronounce the following:<br>
  > **P**it, **T**oe, **C**ot<br>
* A brief puff of air escapes after the stop is released, and before the vocal folds begin vibrating. <br>
  * This puff of air is called aspiration.<br>
* Aspiration is transcribed like this:<br>
* [**p**ʰ], [**t**ʰ], [**k**ʰ]<br>
What do [**p**], [**t**], and [**k**] have in common?<br>

* Can we get even more specific? Think about these pairs.<br>
  > pool [phul], spool [spul]<br>
  > tale [thel], stale [stel]<br>
  > kale [khel], scale [skel]<br>
* When are voiceless oral stops aspirated?<br>
* Voiceless oral stops are aspirated in **word-initial** position.<br>

### Fricatives
* Major, but not complete, obstruction in the vocal tract.<br>
* The opening through which the air escapes is small, so a turbulent noise is produced as a result. (Think of air escaping thtough a punctured tire.)<br>
* Fricative sounds include:<br>
  * [f] as in **f**ish<br>
  * [v] as in **v**ile<br>
  * [θ] as in **th**ick<br>
  * [ð] as in **th**y<br>
  * [s] as in **s**et<br>
  * [z] as in **z**ipper<br>
  * [ʃ] as in **sh**oot<br>
  * [ʒ] as in lei**s**ure<br>
  * [h] as in **h**ouse<br>
* The articulators are so close together that **friction** is created when the air is forced to pass through them.<br>

### Affricates
* Affricates are made by briefly stopping airflow completely, then slightly releasing closure so that a fricative-like noise is made.<br>
* Some phoneticians describe affricates as a stop quickly followed by a fricative.<br>
* Affricate sounds include:<br>
  > [tʃ] as in cheap.<br>
  > [dʒ] as in Joe.<br>

* Practice identifying these sounds according to **voicing**, **place of articulation**, and **manner of articulation**.<br>
  > [tʃ] is a **voiceless, palatal, affricate.** <br>
  > [dʒ] is a **voiced, palatal, affricate.**<br>

### Liquids
  > [I], [r]<br>
* Some minor obstruction of the vocal tract with tongue, but air still passes through.<br>
* We can further distinguish the two English liquids [I] and [r] using an additional feature:<br>
* [I] is a **lateral liquid**.<br>
  * Start to say the word "leaf," but freeze your mouth at the [I]. If you inhale sharply, you'll feel air passing by the sides of your tongue.<br>
* [r] is a **retroflex liquid**.<br>
  * For many, [r] is articulated in the alveolar region, and the tip of the tongue is curled back behind the alveolar ridge.<br>

### Glides:
  > [j], [w]<br>
  > **y**ou→ [**j**u]<br>
  > **wh**at→ [**w**Ʌt]<br>
* [j] is palatal. <br>
* [w] is labio-velar.<br>
* Very small obstruction of airflow: articulators move closer together, but not by very much.<br>
* Very vowel-like: note the similar position of the tongue when producing the vowel in "b**ea**t" and the [j] in "**y**ou."<br>

### Trilled [R]
* Indian English has what is called: **Retroflex trilled [r]** ...which does not exist in Standard American English.<br>

* **Trill:** One articulator touches another in a very rapid fire, repeating motion.<br>

* Examples of trilled [r]:<br>
  * Spanish<br>
  * Indian English<br>
* Dialects of the same language differ in their **phonetic inventories**.<br>
* Your knowledge of your native language includes the phonetic inventory of your specific dialect.<br>

### Consonants Review
* Consonants are distinguished using three features:<br>
* **Place of Articulation**<br>
* **Manner of Articulation**<br>
* **Voicing**<br>
* Make sure that you know the features for the consonants of English.v

### IPA Symbols Review
* Take note of the IPA symbols that are different than those used in English orthography:<br>
  > wrea**th** [θ]<br>
  > ri**ng** [ŋ]<br>
  > brea**the** [ð]<br>
  > **y**ou [j]<br>
  > **sh**eep [ʃ]<br>
  > **ch**ur**ch** [tʃ]<br>
  > mea**su**re [ʒ]<br>
  > **j**u**dg**e [dʒ]<br>
  > **uh-oh** [ʔ]<br>

## Summary
* Your knowledge of language includes knowledge of:<br>
  * **Phonetic inventory** of your language.<br>
  * **Places of articulation** of sounds in your language.<br>
  * **Manners of articulation** of sounds in your language.<br>
  * **Voicing** of sounds in your language.<br>
* We also saw that:<br>
  * Dialects of English differ in their phonetic inventories.<br>
  * Dialects of English differ in "rules" they apply to sounds.<br>
  * Aspiration of word-initial voiceless stops exists in American English, but not in Indian English.<br>
