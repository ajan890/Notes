# Week 4
## Phonetics Knowledge Of Language
* When you know the **phonetics** of your language, what do you actually know?<br>
* What is a **phonetic inventory**?<br>
* The phonetic inventory of a language is the set of sounds in the language.<br>
* The phonetic inventory of American English includes subsets of consonants and vowels.<br>
* It does **not** include other types of sounds.<br>
* What do you know when you know the phonetic inventory of a language?<br>
* You know how to separate a continuous stream of speech into distinct words and a word into distinct sounds.<br>
  > **Mother:** "Hold on!"<br>
  > **Child:** "I'm holing don! I'm holing don!"<br>
* We think we pause between distinct words, but we don't.<br>

## Speech Sound Production: The Basics 
### Vocal Tract
* Structures that work together to produce speech sounds.<br>
* The vocal tract is important to the way we label and define consonants and vowels.<br>

* You should be able to identify these parts of the vocal tract:<br>
  > 1. Alveolar ridge<br>
  > 2. Hard palate<br>
  > 3. Soft palate/velum<br>
  > 4. Uvula<br>
  > 5. Pharynx<br>
  > 6. Glottis<br>

### Orthography
* **Phonetics ≠ Spelling**<br>
* **Same symbol, different sound:**<br>
  > <strong>s</strong>kip<br>
  > <strong>h</strong>ouse<br>
  > <strong>c</strong>lip<br>
  > <strong>s</strong>hip<br>
  > g<strong>h</strong>ost<br>
  > i<strong>c</strong>e<br>
  > rai<strong>s</strong>e<br>
  > <strong>h</strong>our<br>
  > ri<strong>c</strong>h<br>
* **Same sound(s), different symbols:**
  > pu<strong>ff</strong>/rou<strong>gh</strong><br>
  > <strong>shun</strong> / emo<strong>tion</strong><br>
  > <strong>jet</strong> / suffra<strong>gette</strong><br>

  > "Did h<strong>e</strong> bel<strong>ie</strong>ve that C<strong>ae</strong>sar would s<strong>ee</strong> the p<strong>eo</strong>ple s<strong>ei</strong>ze the s<strong>ea</strong>s?" <br>
  * <strong>[i]</strong> = e, ie, ae, ee, eo, ei, ea<br>

  > One reason why I cannot spell, <br>
  > Although I learned the rules quite well <br>
  > Is that some words like <em>coup</em> and <em>through </em><br>
  > Sound just like <em>threw</em> and <em>flue</em> and <em>Who</em>; <br>
  > When <em>oo</em> is never spelled the same, <br>
  > The <em>duice</em> becomes a guessing game; <br>
  > And then I ponder over <em>though</em>, <br>
  > Is it spelled <em>so</em>, or <em>throw</em>, or <em>beau</em>, <br>
  > And <em>bough</em> is never <em>bow</em>, it's <em>bow</em>, <br>
  > I mean the <em>bow</em> that sounds like <em>plow</em>, <br>
  > And not the <em>bow</em> that sounds like <em>row</em>- <br>
  > The <em>row</em> that is pronounced like <em>roe</em>. <br>
  > I wonder, too, why <em>rough</em> and <em>tough</em>, <br>
  > That sound the same as <em>gruff</em> and <em>muff</em>, <br>
  > Are spelled like <em>bough</em> and <em>though</em>, for they <br>
  > Are both pronounced a different way.<br>
  > \- Vivian Buchan, NEA Journal 1966/67<br>

* **Symbols which are not pronounced:**
  > i<strong>s</strong>land<br>
  > <strong>o</strong>possum<br>
  > w<strong>h</strong>ere<br>
  > <strong>p</strong>sychology<br>
  > su<strong>b</strong>tle<br>
  > ans<strong>w</strong>er<br>
  > <strong>k</strong>nife<br>
  > <strong>g</strong>nome<br>
  > mak<strong>e</strong><br>

## International Phonetic Alphabet (Ipa) 
![6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216750862-19dc3d1c-c64f-420f-bb15-813782262fe6.png)<br>
### Rules
* One symbol = one sound<br>
* The International Phonetic Alphabet is universal: it can be used to represent any human language.<br>
* IPA symbols are enclosed in square brackets: <br>
  > phone = [fon]  <br>
  > phonetics = [fǝ'nεriks]<br>

## Consonants Vs. Vowels
* Sounds of languages fall into two classes: **consonants** and **vowels**.<br>
* **Consonants:** produced with some closure in the vocal tract that impedes the flow of air from the lungs.<br>
* In phonetics, consonants and vowels are different types of sounds; not just contrasted with  respect to the alphabet.<br>

## Consonants:
* Consonants are distinguished using three features:<br>
  1. Place of Articulation<br>
  2. Manner of Articulation<br>
  3. Voicing<br>

### Places of Articulation
<strong>Where is the consonant produced?</strong><br>
<strong>Articulation:</strong> part of the mouth (usually the tongue) touches or interacts with another area of the vocal tract.<br>
<strong>There are seven places of articulation.</strong><br>
1. Bilabials<br>
    * Sounds produced by bringing both lips together.  <br>
      > pie, buy, my <br>
      > [p] [b] [m]<br>
   
![11 (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216750974-caefae9f-5525-4d2d-8491-5d094f1de694.png)<br>

2. Labiodentals<br>
    * Sounds produced by touching the bottom lip to the upper teeth.<br>
      > five, view <br>
      > [f] [v]<br>

![12 (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216750978-752cfcae-d8ea-4344-9d40-5c2b8db9b5c2.png)<br>

3. Interdentals:<br>
    * Sounds produced by inserting the tip of the tongue between the upper teeth and the lower teeth.<br>
      > thigh, thus [0] [ð]<br> 

![13 (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216750980-833676a7-521e-44bc-9bfd-45b345f2a1ee.png)<br>


4. Alveolars:<br>
    * Sounds produced by raising the tip of the tongue to the alveolar ridge. (part of the hard palate directly behind the upper front teeth)<br>
      > tie, die, night, sip, zip, light, rock <br>
      > [t] [d] [n] [s] [z] [I] [r]<br>

![14 (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216750984-e149efdd-0a5e-4d99-8415-93dc8a22832e.png)<br>

5. Palatals:<br>
    * Sounds produced by raising the front part of the tongue to the hard palate. (Bony section of the roof of the mouth behind the alveolar ridge)<br>
      > mission, measure, cheap, judge, you <br>
      > [ʃ] [ʒ] [tʃ] [dʒ] [j]<br>

![15 (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216750986-a2b64060-13f1-4535-91a5-cb72332cd1e2.png)<br>

6. Velars:<br>
    * Sounds produced by raising the back of the tongue to the soft palate or velum.<br>
      > back, bag, bang <br>
      > [k] [g] [ŋ]<br>

![16 (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216750987-f9195592-7224-4717-90c3-4b0643a3b34f.png)<br>


7. Glottals:<br>
    > high [h], uh-oh [ʔ]<br> 
    * [h] produced with the flow of air through the open glottis.<br>
    * [ʔ] produced if the air is stopped completely at the glottis by tightly closed vocal cords: glottal stop.<br>

![17 (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216750988-0263d4cc-0644-4ef3-9c6c-d7ca06fab3e5.png)<br>

8. Labio-velar (i.e., bilabial AND velar): <br>
    * Sounds produced by a combination of pursed lips and raising the back of the tongue to the velum.<br>
      > witch, and which<br>
      > [w] [w]<br>

![18 (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216750990-028cc2d6-6822-4966-95d1-903e1f258ac8.png)<br>

<strong>Places of Articulation Reivew</strong><br>
* **Bilabials:** **p**ie, **b**uy, **m**y <br>
  > [**p**] [**b**] [**m**] <br>
* **Labiodentals:** **f**ive, **v**iew <br>
  > [**f**] [**v**] <br>
* **Interdentals:** **th**igh, **th**us<br>
  > [**θ**] [**ð**]<br>
* **Alveolars:** **t**ie, **d**ie, **n**ight, **s**ip, **z**ip, **l**ight, **r**ock <br>
  > [**t**] [**d**] [**n**] [**s**] [**z**] [**l**] [**r**]<br>
* **Palatals:** mi**ss**ion, mea**s**ure, **ch**eap, ju**dg**e, **y**ou<br>
  > [**S**] [**ʒ**] [**tʃ**] [**dʒ**] [**j**]<br>
* **Velars:** bac**k**, ba**g**, ba**ng**<br>
  > [**k**] [**g**] [**ŋ**]<br>
* **Glottals:** **h**igh, **u**h-oh<br>
  > [**h**] [**ʔ**]<br>
* **Labio-velars:** **w**itch, and **wh**ich<br>
  > [**w**] [**w**]<br>

<strong>Practice Set</strong><br>
* Identify the initial sound in the words below according to place of articulation.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong><br>
  > "Fight" begins with a labiodental sound.<br>
  > A. "Horse" begins with a glottal sound.<br>
  > B. "Cat" begins with a velar sound.<br>
  > C. "Baby" begins with a bilabial sound.<br>
  > D. "Dog" begins with an alveolar sound.<br>
  > E. "This" begins with an interdental sound.<br>

## Voicing
* Are the vocal folds vibrating (voiced) or not (voiceless-open glottis)?<br>
  > **P**ie vs. **B**uy<br>
  > **T**ie vs. **D**ie<br>
  > **C**ap vs. **G**ap<br>

### Voiceless vs Voiced Sounds
* **Voiceless:** Vocal folds/cords are **apart**, air flows freely through glottis.<br>
**s**u**p**er [supər]<br>
* **Voiced:** Vocal folds/cords are **together**, air forces through, causing vibrations.<br>

![22_img](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216751088-5e3c5467-27b9-4277-9529-5de0bdb8df10.png)

<strong>Example:</strong><br>
* [s] and [z] differ only in voicing.<br>
  * [s] is **voiceless**.<br>
  * [z] is **voiced**.<br>

* Put your hand on your throat. <br>
  > sssssssssss zzzzzzzzz sssssssss zzzzzzz<br>
* Notice that your tongue does not change position!<br>
* If you put your hand on your throat while you say these sounds, can you feel the difference between consonants?<br>
  > [p] - pear<br>
  > [p] is **voiceless**<br>

  > [v] - vine<br>
  > [v] is **voiced**<br>

  > [f] - fine<br>
  > [f] is **voiceless**<br>

## Manner Of Articulation
* How is the consonant produced?<br>
* **Stops:** There is a complete obstruction of airflow somewhere in the vocal tract.<br>
* **Oral stops:**<br>
  > [p] [b] [t] [d] [k] [g] [ʔ]<br>
* The velum is raised to block the nasal cavity so that when the stop is released, the air flows out through the mouth.<br>
* Sounds can only be heard when released into a vowel or another sound.<br>

![26 (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216751120-c01bf56f-b6cd-4852-8410-93fb7149aaf1.png)<br>

* **Nasal stops:**<br>
  > [m] [n] [n]<br>
* The velum is lowered to open the nasal cavity.<br>

![27 (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216751140-ee332015-a17e-47ff-a2a9-e2a23f18de52.png)<br>

* What feature distinguishes the bold sounds on the left from the ones on the right?<br>
  > cab [kæb] (Oral) vs. cam [kæm] (Nasal)<br>
  > raid [red] (Oral) VS. rain [ren] (Nasal)<br>
  > rug [rɅg] (Oral) VS. rung [rɅŋ] (Nasal)<br>

## Voicing
### Aspiration
* Put your hand in front of your mouth and pronounce the following:<br>
  > **P**it, **T**oe, **C**ot<br>
* A brief puff of air escapes after the stop is released, and before the vocal folds begin vibrating. <br>
  * This puff of air is called aspiration.<br>
* Aspiration is transcribed like this:<br>
* [**p**ʰ], [**t**ʰ], [**k**ʰ]<br>
What do [**p**], [**t**], and [**k**] have in common?<br>

* Can we get even more specific? Think about these pairs.<br>
  > pool [phul], spool [spul]<br>
  > tale [thel], stale [stel]<br>
  > kale [khel], scale [skel]<br>
* When are voiceless oral stops aspirated?<br>
* Voiceless oral stops are aspirated in **word-initial** position.<br>

### Fricatives
* Major, but not complete, obstruction in the vocal tract.<br>
* The opening through which the air escapes is small, so a turbulent noise is produced as a result. (Think of air escaping thtough a punctured tire.)<br>
* Fricative sounds include:<br>
  * [f] as in **f**ish<br>
  * [v] as in **v**ile<br>
  * [θ] as in **th**ick<br>
  * [ð] as in **th**y<br>
  * [s] as in **s**et<br>
  * [z] as in **z**ipper<br>
  * [ʃ] as in **sh**oot<br>
  * [ʒ] as in lei**s**ure<br>
  * [h] as in **h**ouse<br>
* The articulators are so close together that **friction** is created when the air is forced to pass through them.<br>

### Affricates
* Affricates are made by briefly stopping airflow completely, then slightly releasing closure so that a fricative-like noise is made.<br>
* Some phoneticians describe affricates as a stop quickly followed by a fricative.<br>
* Affricate sounds include:<br>
  > [tʃ] as in cheap.<br>
  > [dʒ] as in Joe.<br>

* Practice identifying these sounds according to **voicing**, **place of articulation**, and **manner of articulation**.<br>
  > [tʃ] is a **voiceless, palatal, affricate.** <br>
  > [dʒ] is a **voiced, palatal, affricate.**<br>

### Liquids
  > [I], [r]<br>
* Some minor obstruction of the vocal tract with tongue, but air still passes through.<br>
* We can further distinguish the two English liquids [I] and [r] using an additional feature:<br>
* [I] is a **lateral liquid**.<br>
  * Start to say the word "leaf," but freeze your mouth at the [I]. If you inhale sharply, you'll feel air passing by the sides of your tongue.<br>
* [r] is a **retroflex liquid**.<br>
  * For many, [r] is articulated in the alveolar region, and the tip of the tongue is curled back behind the alveolar ridge.<br>

### Glides:
  > [j], [w]<br>
  > **y**ou→ [**j**u]<br>
  > **wh**at→ [**w**Ʌt]<br>
* [j] is palatal. <br>
* [w] is labio-velar.<br>
* Very small obstruction of airflow: articulators move closer together, but not by very much.<br>
* Very vowel-like: note the similar position of the tongue when producing the vowel in "b**ea**t" and the [j] in "**y**ou."<br>

### Trilled [R]
* Indian English has what is called: **Retroflex trilled [r]** ...which does not exist in Standard American English.<br>

* **Trill:** One articulator touches another in a very rapid fire, repeating motion.<br>

* Examples of trilled [r]:<br>
  * Spanish<br>
  * Indian English<br>
* Dialects of the same language differ in their **phonetic inventories**.<br>
* Your knowledge of your native language includes the phonetic inventory of your specific dialect.<br>

### Consonants Review
* Consonants are distinguished using three features:<br>
  * **Place of Articulation**<br>
  * **Manner of Articulation**<br>
  * **Voicing**<br>
* Make sure that you know the features for the consonants of English.v

### IPA Symbols Review
* Take note of the IPA symbols that are different than those used in English orthography:<br>
  > wrea**th** [θ]<br>
  > ri**ng** [ŋ]<br>
  > brea**the** [ð]<br>
  > **y**ou [j]<br>
  > **sh**eep [ʃ]<br>
  > **ch**ur**ch** [tʃ]<br>
  > mea**su**re [ʒ]<br>
  > **j**u**dg**e [dʒ]<br>
  > **uh-oh** [ʔ]<br>

## Vowels have four features
* <strong>Tongue position (frontness/backness):</strong> How far back in your mouth is your tongue artculating?
* <strong>Tongue height (high/mid/low):</strong> What is the height of the tongue?
* <strong>Tenseness:</strong> Is your tongue more tense or lax?
* <strong>Lip rounding:</strong> Are your lips rounded or unrounded?

### Feature 1: Tongue Position
* English vowels can be divided in three ways:
* <strong>Front:</strong>
  > [i] beet, [ɪ] bit, [e] bait, [ɛ] bet, [æ] bat
* <strong>Central:</strong>
  > [ə] about, [ʌ] but, [a] cot
* <strong>Back:</strong>
  > [u] boot, [ʊ] book, [o] boat, [ɔ] caught

### Feature 2: Tongue Height
* One feature is not enough. Need to differentiate further:
* <strong>High:</strong>
  > [i] beet, [ɪ] bit, [u] boot, [ʊ] book

![6_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216808278-18db09f1-00eb-4322-8bfe-616f4fbb087c.png)

* <strong>Mid:</strong>
  > [e] bait, [ɛ] bet, [ə] about, [ʌ] but, [o] boat, [ɔ] bought

![7_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216808282-16f427e3-24fc-433d-a120-de448c9971ca.png)

* <strong>Low:</strong>
  > [æ] bat, [a] cot

![8_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216808286-d6eddaa2-d0de-4791-afb2-e353171bac83.png)

<strong>Tongue Height Summary:</strong>
* High - [i] beet, [ɪ] bit, [u] boot, [ʊ] book
* Mid - [e] bait, [ɛ] bet, [ǝ] about, [ʌ] but, [o] boat, [ɔ] bought 
* Low - [a] bat, [a] cot

![9_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216808288-6f38cce6-d3cf-4537-8ba6-7299b2d014e2.png)

### Vowel Chart
Using Vowel Backness and Vowel Height, we can create the following vowel chart:

![10_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216808292-d7d4dd44-6ed4-44ba-8a8d-718fe9ed98b5.png)

But we still need to be able to differentiate [i] & [ɪ] bit; [u] & [ʊ]; [e] & [ε], [o] & [ɔ].

### Feature 3: Tenseness
* Hints to remember the Tense / Lax distinction:
* Tense vowels are slightly higher than lax vowels.
* Tense vowels are slightly longer than lax vowels.
* The IPA symbols (not sounds!) we use to represent the tense vowels are the standard "vowel letters" that we were taught in grade school!
  > [a] [e] [i] [o] [u]

### Feature 4: Lip Rounding
* Which vowels in English are rounded, and wWhich vowels in English are unrounded?
  * Rounded vowels include [u], [ʊ], [o], [ɔ] 
  * Unrounded vowels include [i], [ɪ], [e], [ɛ], [æ], [ɑ], [ʌ], [ə].
  
<strong>Note on Vowel Sound [ɔ] - Cot-Caught Merger</strong>
* What is [ɔ] in some dialects is [a] for other speakers. [a] and [ɔ] have been merged.
* This is called the cot-caught merger.
* If you're a native English speaker from west of the Mississippi, you probably have merged [a] and [2].
* Do you pronounce "cot" and "caught" the same?

![14_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216808308-9371ca0c-0501-4a60-96e1-fa0cbfa231c6.png)

We can use the vowel features that we've looked at to see differences in vowel inventories across languages.

* <strong>Unround Back Vowel</strong>
  * English has the mid back round vowel [o].
  * Estonian has both [o] and its unrounded counterpart [ɤ]:

![16_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216808312-409a2b97-2387-4ac5-baeb-7f7ddd30888b.png)

### Putting the Features Together
* What is the difference between the vowels in these words? (backness, height, tenseness)
  > beet vs. boot: [i] vs [u] Backness
  > beet vs. bat: [i] vs [æ] Height and Tenseness
  > beet vs. bit: [i] vs [ɪ] Tenseness

* Use height, backness, rounding, and tenseness to describe the vowels in these words:
  > fit = High, front, unrounded, lax vowel - [ɪ]
  > could = High, back, rounded, lax vowel - [ʊ]
  > at = Low, front, unrounded, lax vowel - [æ]
  > said = Mid, front, unrounded, lax vowel - [ε]

### Diphthongs
* How would you identify the vowels in
  > eye
  > boy
  > house
* These vowel sounds are different than the sounds in beet or bet; they combine two vowels (or a vowel and a glide).
* They are called diphthongs, and there are at least three of them in English.
  * [aj] as in the word 'eye.'
  * [ɔj] as in the word 'boy.'
  * [aw] as in the word 'house.'

* How would you transcribe these words in IPA?
  > Coy = [kʰɔj]
  > Scout = [skɑwt]
  > Sight = [sajt]
  > Cow = [kʰaw]

## Natural Classes
* <strong>Natural Classes:</strong> Groups of sounds can be identified by sharing particular features.
* <strong>Example:</strong>
  * [h] and [ʔ] share two features, they are both glottal and voiceless.
  * When we group sounds according to natural class, we look for the feature or features they have in common.

### Alveolar Stops
* For example, if we want to define the natural class that includes [t], [d], and [n], we can list two features:
  * All three sounds are <strong>alveolar stops</strong>.
  * Now if we want to define a natural class that includes only [t] and [d], we need to be more specific to eliminate [n].
  * What are the features that uniquely define [t] and [d]?

* Let's group these sounds into their natural classes. What feature(s) does each group have in common?
  > [b] [d] [g] (Voiced, oral stops)
  > [m] [n] [ŋ] (Voiced, nasal stops)
  > [f] [v] [θ] [ð] [s] [z] [ʃ] [ʒ] [h] (Fricatives)
  > [p][t] [k] [f][θ][s] [ʃ] [h] [tʃ] (Voiceless)
  > [f] [θ] [s] [ʃ] [h] (Voiceless fricatives)

* We can group vowels according to natural class, as well. What feature do these vowels have in common?
  > [i] [e] [u] [o] [a] (Tense vowels)
  > [i] [ɪ] [e] [ε] [æ] (Front vowels)
  > [i] [ɪ] [u] [ʊ] (High vowels)
  > [u] [ʊ] [o] [ɔ] (Back vowels)

### Vowel Differences Across Dialects
* The concept of "natural class" is useful in helping us to understand differences between dialects.
* Let's take a listen at Conor, who will give us some words in Canadian English.
* In Canadian Raising, the diphthongs pronounced as [aj] and [aw] in Standard American English are raised to [ʌj] and [ʌw]. But notice that it does not happen in all cases.

<strong>Canadian Raising</strong>
* In Canadian English, the nucleus of the diphthongs /aj/ and /aw/ are raised to [ʌ] before voiceless consonants.

## Transcription
<strong>Transcription</strong> is rendering a word in IPA:

![transcription](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216809344-b77b7656-d87d-461c-a1f1-eeb6d0f4125d.png)

<strong>Reverse Transcription</strong> is going from IPA to English orthography.

### Potential Stumbling Blocks
* Sometimes there are more sounds in a word than there are letters in the English spelling: 
  > spinal [spajnǝl]
* Other times, there are far fewer sounds than there are letters: 
  > through [θru]
* The same letters can be used to represent different sounds:
  > misses [mɪsɪz]
* The same sound can be represented by different letters:
  > tracked [trækt]

* Transcribe this sentence
  > [træskrɪpʃin kæn bi trɪki -- biwer ɪŋglɪʃ orθagrɅfi!]
  > Transcription can be tricky -- beware English orthagraphy
* <strong>Don't depend on spelling; do learn to trust your ears.</strong>
* The aim of a transcription is to represent the actual speech sounds produced when someone says the word (phrase, sentence, etc.).
* Standard orthography is notoriously unreliable.
* You may find it helpful to close your eyes and say the word to yourself a few times before you begin transcribing it.

### Syllabic Sounds
* Every language has rules about which sounds can function as the center of a syllable.
* Syllable nuclei in English: almost always vowels, but occasionally we allow liquids and nasals to act as the nucleus.
* Syllabic consonants are marked with diacritics [ˌ]
* English allows syllabic [I], [r], [m], and [n]:

<strong>Schwa [ə]</strong>
* These sounds can also be represented with a schwa [ə] + [l/r/m/n].

<strong>Syllabic Sounds Transcription</strong>
* Remember that transcription is an attempt to accurately indicate the speech sounds that you use when you say a word.
* So, if you have a strong intuition that there is a vowel between [z] and [l] when you say "dazzle," transcribe it with a schwa:
  > [dæzəl]
* If you have a strong intuition that there is no vowel between [z] and [l] when you say "dazzle," transcribe it with a syllabic [l̩]:
  > [dæzl̩]

## Phonetics Examples
* Sounds can be decomposed into features.
  * [**b**] in boy is a voiced, bilabial, oral stop.
  * <strong>Phonetics</strong> can help us to characterize differences between dialects in the real world.

### [j] Dropping - American vs. British English
* Consider the following words.  Given this small data set, where does American English delete the [**j**]?
  > "Tune", "Zeus", "Dew", "Puny", "News", "Beauty", "Suit", "Cute", "Hue"

* [**j**] is dropped in:
  > [t] 'Tune', [d] 'Dew', [s] 'Suit', [z] 'Zeus', [n] 'News'
* [**j**] is retained in:
  > [p] 'Puny', [b] 'Beauty', [k] 'Cute', [h] 'Hue'
* What do these sounds have in common?
* Generalization: the [j] is deleted in American English after a <strong>word-initial alveolar consonant.</strong>
* The idea of <strong>natural class</strong> can be useful!
* However, these words are pronounced the same in British and American English:
  > [t] "Tool", [d] "Do", [s] "Soon", [z] "Zoo", [n] "Noose"
* Why are these the same, since they have word-initial alveolars?
* They didn't have a [j] in them in the first place!
* We can understand that American English has a rule of jod deletion in certain environments.

### [r] Dropping: Phonetics and Social Class
<strong>Labov (1966) New York City.</strong>
* Goal was to show systematic variation in [r] pronunciation, based on:
  * <strong>Social class</strong>
  * <strong>Attention paid to speech</strong>
  * <strong>Linguistic context of a variant</strong>
* The local dialect of New York City is an "r-less" dialect.
* The [r] found in in SAE is dropped in certain cases.
* Let's look at some examples in IPA.
  * Where are the [r]'s dropped?
  * It looks like the [r]'s get dropped in word-final position and when the [r] precedes another consonant.

<strong>In New York City dialect, pronunciation of [r] is prestigious.</strong>
* [r]-dropping is considered characteristic of the "lower classes."
* In general in the US, dropped [r] in words like "car," "father," and "bark" are perceived as features of <strong>nonstandard speech</strong>.
* Labov wanted to investigate the factors that influence the [r]-drop.
  * Labov went to three different department stores:
    * Saks Fifth Avenue (expensive)
    * Macy's (mid-range)
    * Klein's (low prices)
  * At each store, Labov asked for the location of something for sale on the fourth floor.
  * [forθ flor]
    * Notice that there are two [r] sounds.

![8_example_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216814952-6d3d2270-60ee-4306-be2b-ae4c40382b75.png)

  * Labov asked the question, then said "Excuse me" at the response, to make the worker repeat the phrase "fourth floor," but the second time more carefully.
  * Labov then collected the data:

![8_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216814966-44eaadcf-3030-4545-86c2-0989d42cd7d5.png)

  * Labov found out that at the more expensive stores, the workers there were less likely to drop the [r].
* There is relation between the <strong>realization</strong> or <strong>pronunciation</strong> of [**r**] and <strong>social class</strong>.
* The dropping of [**r**] is perceived as indicative of "bad grammar" or "bad speech."
* In fact, it's a <strong>marker</strong> of the speech of people lower on the socio-economic ladder.
* From a linguistic standpoint, dropping [r] is no better or worse than not dropping [r].
* In another study, Labov looked at the realization of [r] when it occurs just before a consonant.
  * This is when [r] would be dropped in the New York City dialect typically.
  * Labov found out that the results from his department store study could be replicated.
  * There is a relationship between <strong>social class</strong> and the pronunciation of [r].

![10_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216815121-b1cc79a8-b58a-4057-93a5-a911d21ce5ee.png)

<strong>Received Pronunciation</strong><br>
* As in the department store study, the dropping of [r] is associated with lower social classes in NYC.
* It's useful to think about this relationship and consider a different dialect. Think about the pronunciation of [r].
* Do you notice anything "funny" about the pronunciation of [r] in the speech of these upper class British speakers?
* They are speaking a dialect called "<strong>Received Pronunciation</strong>" (RP).
  * In Received Pronunciation, the prestige dialect, [**r**] is dropped!
  * It's an [r]-less dialect.
* Peter Trudgill studied [**r**] in Reading, England.
* Trudgill looked at how people from different socio-economic groups pronounced [r].

<strong>[r]-deletion in New York City versus Reading, England:</strong>

![13_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216816962-01b147cc-e38d-4657-83cf-54f4e747f1dc.png)
![13_image2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/216816964-c9c4a510-8850-436a-baa4-55b6deeb9f49.png)
* Since <em>not</em> pronouncing the [r] is the prestige dialect in England, the results are the opposite compared to what was found in New York.

### Taking Stock
* Dialect differences in phonetics are not random: British vs. American English and [j].
* Linguistic differences between dialects may be related to <strong>non-linguistic factors</strong> like <strong>social class</strong>.
* The phonetic markers of social class are arbitrary.
* Is [r]-drop better or worse than not doing [r]-drop? 
  * It depends on where you are!
* The prestige or lack of prestige associated with particular phonetic markers is **not** random:
  * The more marginalized the speakers, the more marginalized their speech forms.
* By studying phonetic differences between dialects and how they correlate with social class, we can see how attitudes towards non-standard dialects are shaped.

## What is Phonology? (Review)
<strong>Phonology:</strong>
* How speech sounds are organized in different languages.
* Phonology is the linguistic knowledge a speaker has of the sound patterns that are possible in a language:
  * "pan" [pæn]
  * "pancake" [pæn kek]
  * "pan bread" [pæm brεd]
* Notice in the three above examples, "pan" is pronounced differently every time.
* Your phonology lets you know which combinations of sounds are possible ("blik") versus the ones that aren't ("\*lbik").
  > [tʰjun] vs [tʰun]
* American English does not permit certain combinations of sounds in word initial position.
* The phonological rule here is that when [j] follows word-initial alveolar sounds, it is dropped.
* Not dropped from other words:
  > "Puny", "Beauty", "Hue", "Cute"

### Questions that Phonologists Ask
* What is the <strong>organization of sounds</strong> in a given language?
* Which sounds are <strong>predictable</strong> and which sounds are <strong>unpredictable</strong> based on the environment?
* What is the <strong>phonetic context</strong> (environment) which allows us to predict the appearance or disappearance of one sound versus another?

## Sign Language Phonetics
* To what extent are signed languages like spoken languages?
* It looks like you can express anything in a signed language that you can in a spoken language.
  * You can even do a rap competition!
* Signed language is not produced using the vocal tract.
  * So can we find "phonetics" in signed languages?
  * What about the signs used in signed languages?

### American Sign Language Phonetics
<strong>Handshapes:</strong>
* Just like spoken languages differ in their phonetic inventories, signed languages differ in the handshapes that are permissible.
* It's not the case that everything goes!
* In spoken language, the individual sounds in a word are meaningless.
  > "dog" = [dɔg] [d] = ? [p] = ? [g] = ?
* ASL handshapes are, by themselves, meaningless.
* When we think about sounds in language, we can now think in terms of features.
  > [t] = voiceless, alveolar, oral, stop
  > [n] = voiced, alveolar, nasal, stop

<strong>Phonetics Parameters</strong>
* It turns out that we can find the analog to phonetic features in signed languages!
* <strong>Parameters</strong> (or <strong>primes</strong>): Discrete units of a sign, or discrete units.
  * <strong>Handshape</strong>
  * <strong>Place of articulation</strong>
  * <strong>Movement</strong>
  * <strong>Palm orientation</strong>
* These are not all of the parameters of signs, but we'll focus on these.

<strong>Back to English</strong>
* Before looking at ASL handshape, let's think about English.
* Consider two words:
  > [nid] "need"
  > [did] "deed"
* In terms of features of the initial consonants, what is the only difference between these two words?
  > [n] = voiced, alveolar, nasal, stop 
  > [d] = voiced, alveolar, oral, stop
* So if we change one feature of the initial consonant, we get a different word.
* Of course, we could make other featural changes and also get different words:
  > [sid] [s] = voiceless, alveolar, oral, fricative

<strong>ASL Place, Movement, Palm Orientation</strong>
* There are signs in ASL that have the same handshape (and motion), but differ only in the where the sign is articulated.
* There are ASL signs that are distinguished only by the <strong>movement</strong> in the sign.
* There are ASL signs that differ only in the <strong>orientation of the palm</strong>.
* <strong>Phonology</strong>: sound systems in spoken language and how sounds can influence one another.
* It turns out that there is also <strong>sign language phonology</strong>!

# Summary
* Your knowledge of language includes knowledge of:<br>
  * **Phonetic inventory** of your language.<br>
  * **Places of articulation** of sounds in your language.<br>
  * **Manners of articulation** of sounds in your language.<br>
  * **Voicing** of sounds in your language.<br>
* We also saw that:<br>
  * Dialects of English differ in their phonetic inventories.<br>
  * Dialects of English differ in "rules" they apply to sounds.<br>
  * Aspiration of word-initial voiceless stops exists in American English, but not in Indian English.<br>
* We characterize vowels using a different set of features than for consonants.

### Consonants:
* Consonants are distinguished using three features:<br>
  1. Place of Articulation<br>
    * Bilabials, Labiodentals, Interdentals, Alveolars, Palatals, Velars, Glottals, Labio-Velars
  2. Manner of Articulation<br>
    * Stops, Oral Stops, Nasal Stops
  3. Voicing<br>
    * Aspiration, Fricatives, Affricates, Liquids, Glides, Trilled [R]
### Vowels:
  * Tongue Position: frontness/backness
  * Tongue Height: high/mid/low
  * Tenseness: tense/lax
  * Lip Rounding: rounded/unrounded
* Using these features, we could get a handle on differences across dialects. For example, some English dialects do not have a low, back, round, lax vowel [ɔ].
* Using these features, we could also understand exactly how to discuss vowel differences between languages, like English vs. Estonian.
  * We also saw that using the phonetic features was central to the concept of natural class.
  * We can use natural class to understand processes like
  * Canadian Raising.
    * Crucially, Canadian Raising is a rule-governed process and we determined when it occurs.
* Part of the speaker's knowledge of language must include knowledge of phonetic features of consonants and vowels.

### Phonetics
* From our preliminary evidence, it looks like we can talk about sign language phonetics and sign language phonology.
* Signs in signed languages are not unanalyzable gestures.
* They can be broken down into features that make them similar to sounds.
* This provides further support for the idea that sign language grammars have the same building blocks or components as spoken languages.
* More generally, we've seen that phonetics is very useful for helping us understand ways that dialects and languages differ.
* There is tight connection between dialect phonetic features and non-linguistic factors like social class, geography, etc.
* The study of phonetics is very useful in helping us to understand certain aspects of signed languages.
