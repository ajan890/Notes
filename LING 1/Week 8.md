# Week 8
## Language Contact
* **Overview**
  * Language contact occurs when two or more languages or dialects come into extended contact with each other
  * Languages (and speakers) do not exist in isolation, but in social settings
  * Thus when we talk about language contact, we are talking about human contact = contact between people who speak distinct languages
* **Outcomes**
  * What happens when cultures with multiple different languages come into contact?
  * Widespread bilingualism/codeswitching:
    * Seen in many areas of Africa and Asia
  * Selection of lingua franca:
    * Any language used to enable communication between groups of people with differing native languages
      * (Natural or constructed languages)
  * Language creation:
    * Pidgins and creoles
  * Language shift/endangerment and language death

### Borrowing
* Borrowing is extremely common and need not be the result of extended contact between languages
* Borrowing words:
  * English adopted “chimichanga” from Spanish.
* Borrowing phonetics:
  * English adopted [ʒ] from French
* Borrowing morphology:
  * English adopted incredible from French;
  * -able/ible then became a productive suffix.

#### Borrowing Morphology
* **Shm- reduplication in English:**
    > “Books, shmooks, I don’t care what you’ve read.”<br>
    > “Flu, shmu, he’s not worried about getting sick.”<br>
    > "Understandable, undershmandable, he’s still really rude.”<br>
    > “Breakfast, shmreakfast!”<br>
    * (From the film Mallrats)
  * Shm- reduplication usually has a dismissive or pejorative connotation
  * Shm- first attested use in YiddishL
    * Shmallig (c. 1600 to disparage hallig “holy”)
  * Borrowed into American English from Yiddish in late 19th century and became integrated into common usage in the 1930s
  * Shm- reduplication must be the source of “Joe Shmo”
  * Notice that [∫m-] does not occur in native English words.
* **Borrowing Syntax**
* English has two ways of asking the reason for something:
  > “Why” and “How come”<br>
* “How come” was borrowed from Yiddish into English.
* It has a different syntactic behavior than “why.”
  > “Why did John eat the Alpo?” (subject auxiliary inversion)<br>
  > \* “Why John did eat the Alpo?” (ungrammatical)<br>
  > “How come John ate the Alpo?” (No subject Auxilary Inversion)<br>
  > “How come did John eat the Alpo?”<br>

#### How Does Language Contact Occur?
* Language contact occurs in situations where groups of speakers of different languages come into contact with one another through:
  * Geography
  * Conquest/war
  * Trade
* It is usually the case that when groups come together, they are not equal in power or prestige.

#### Language contact terminology
* **Adtrates:**
  * Languages in contact that have equal prestige.
    * Adstrate: English ←→ Norse
* **Superstrate:**
  * Language of the dominant group
* **Lexifier Language:**
  * The input language that provided most of the basic vocabulary or lexicon (aka “superstrate”)
* **Substrate:**
  * Language of the less dominant or subordinate group
  * Typically provides most of the phonological, and usually, grammatical features
* **Superstrate:**
  * English --------> Substrate: Native American Languages

## Pidgins and Creoles
* Pidgins and creoles are languages that arise in extended contact situations
* They are the result of language creation
* We will explore the similarities and differences between pidgins and creoles

### Pidgins
* Speakers of mutually unintelligible languages are often brought together, perhaps through economic, political, or social factors
* In order to communicate with each other, they need to overcome the lack of a common language
* One solution: creation of a pidgin language.
* Pidgin:
  * Simplified language used in specific interactions such as business, service, and trade
* Pidgins are found around the globe<br>

#### Properties of Pidgins
* Pidgins have no native speakers. That is, pidgin languages are second languages for everyone who speaks one
* Pidgins are governed by convention. They have established vocabulary and grammatical structures.
* Thus, a person can speak a pidgin well or poorly (or somewhere in between
* Pidgins have grammars that are simpler than the grammars of their source languages.
* Simplicity of grammar is one the characteristics of Pidgins
* The vocabulary of pidgins is usually highly restricted and contains few (if any) terms for abstract objects
* Pidgins are not mutually intelligible with their source languages.
* Pidgin forms of English are usually different enough from English that native speakers of English will have to learn the pidgin.


#### Chinese Pidgin English 
* Consider this dialogue from Chinese Pidgin English, which was spoken in Canton, China from about the late 17th century until about around 1900
* Like many pidgins, Chinese Pidgin English has a very restricted vocabulary, about 750 words.
* Most words in the pidgin were derived from English, but modified to fit the phonological structure of Cantonese
  * Superstrate English: → Substrate Cantonese
* Term pidgin might come from the word for “business” in Chinese Pidgin English<br>

#### Nigerian Pidgin (English, Igbo/Yoruba)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/224264110-10cf868b-be0d-41ae-ad02-b17a7585a2ff.png)<br>
* Several million people speak Nigerian Pidgin, and none are native speakers.
* Nigeria is a place where we might expect a pidgin to develop.
* Over 400 living languages throughout Nigeria.
* Lexifier language: English
* Heavy influence from Igbo/Yoruba<br>

### Creoles
#### Overview
* A pidgin is a second (or third or fourth) language for everyone who speaks it.
* Once children begin to acquire a pidgin as a native language, it becomes a creole.
* As children acquire a pidgin as an L1, they transform its minimal grammar into a thorough, complex grammar.
* There are many creole languages around the world in: Caribbean, in West Africa, and Islands of the Pacific (Polynesia, Micronesia, Melanesia, New Guinea)
* Note:
  * Many creoles include the word “pidgin” in their name
    * (i.e. Hawaiian Pidgin English) This is purely historical.
    * Hawaiian Pidgin English is a creole!
  * It is critical to note that they are not “broken” versions of other languages

#### English Creole Data
* One language (the lexifier language) often supplies most of the vocabulary for pidgins and creoles.
* The idea that pidgins (creoles especially) are “broken” forms of other languages stems from the existence of lexifier languages.
* Guyanese Creole English Data:
* “Shi wuda bin sing” → “She would have sung”
* “Shi bin get fu riid.” → “She was allowed to read.”

#### Creoles And Colonization
* Historically, most present-day creoles arose on plantations in the parts of the New World, of the Indian and the Pacific Oceans and of West Africa colonized by Europeans<br>

* Creoles arose because different groups of speakers needed to communicate
* There were several possible substrate languages (e.g. Fongbe and other African languages in Haiti) but no group was large enough or strong enough to push their one language
* In Hawai’, there were Japanese, Hawaiian, Portuguese, and Chinese workers on the sugarcane plantations

* Look at the distribution of English lexifier creoles.

* **Hawaiian Creole/Pidgin English**<br>

* Hawaiian Creole English (HCE):
  * Low status.
  * Blared for poor education test scores.
  * Not college level (just casual talk)
  * Associated with lower class (stigmatized as inferior).
  * Considered substandard or broken English
* 600,000 people speak HCE.
* KCCNFM 100 radio plays regular HCE programs and music (kccndm100.com)
* New Testament has been “translated” into HCE, “Da Jesus Book”<br>

* **Jamaican Creole English (Patwa/Patois)**
  * Jamaican Creole English is also known as “patois”
  * It is spoken on the Caribbean island of Jamaica.

### Properties of Pidgins and Creoles
#### Phonetics and Phonology
* Simplified consonant clusters:
  * Cameroonian Pidgin English:
    * “Strong” [trɔŋ]
    * “Dust” [dɔs]
  * Tok Pisin (Creole):
    * “Drunk” [spak]
    * “grass/hair/fur” [gras]
* “Stopping” of fricatives:
  * Tok Pisin (Creole):
    * “Think” [tiŋk]
    * “They” [deI]
    * “Find” [painim]
* Phonetics
  * Pidgins and creoles tend to have sounds that are very common in the world’s languages.
  * Usually, cross-linguistically rare sounds are not found in pidgins or creoles.
  * Pidgins are not tonal, even when the input languages are tonal!

#### Morphology
* Pidgins lack inflections morphology:
  * Cameroonian Pidgin English:
    > “Wings” [wiŋ]<br>
    > “Thinks” [tiŋk]<br>
  * Use of reduplication to avoid homonymy, to indicate plural.
    * Solomons Pidgin English:
      > “Pigs” [pikipiki]<br>
  * It’s not uncommon for creoles to lack inflectional morphology, but some do have it.

* **Jamaican Creole English Morphology**
  * Plural Formation:
    * Plural nouns are formed by combining an unmarked noun with 3rd plural pronoun “dem” (defines only).<br>
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/224287201-03525c93-4b99-40fd-91f8-9c7dfbe426b0.png)<br>
* **Syntax**
* Pidgins may have flexible word order:
  * Jamaican Pidgin English:
    > “Mi bammy eat.”<br>
    > “Mi eat bammy.”<br>
    > “I eat the cassava.”<br>
    * Creoles tend to have more fixed word order.
    * Jamaican Creole: Only one word order is allowed.
    > "Mi &nbsp; a-go &nbsp; tel  &nbsp; shi &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; se &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mi &nbsp; &nbsp; waa &nbsp; nyam &nbsp; di &nbsp; &nbsp; bammy."<br>
    > 1sg &nbsp; FUT &nbsp;  tell &nbsp; 3sg &nbsp; COMP  &nbsp; 1sg &nbsp; want &nbsp; eat &nbsp; &nbsp; DET &nbsp; cassava.<br>
    * "I will tell her that I want to eat the cassava"
    * Basic word order tends to be Subject-Verb-Object
  * Hawaiian Creole English:<br>
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/224288821-fbe8fb8d-68bb-49ec-98ed-cb2259be59c1.png)<br>

* Pidgins: no complex sentences
* Creoles; fully developed grammars with complex sentences possible
* Pidgins do not have definite or indefinite articles
* Many creoles lack articles, but some do have them<br>

## Language Loss
### Endangerment and Death
* This occurs when people no longer speak a particular language.
* Usually, it's because they adopt another language.
  * Not because the population that spoke the language died off.

### Scale of Langauge Loss (Ethnologue)
* Number of anguages in the world: 6912
* 347 languages (~5%) have over a million speakers.
* 94% of world population speaks one of these languages.
* The remaining 95% of languages are spoken by 6% of the world population.
  * Of these 95%:
    * 497 languages (~7%) are "nearly extinct" (<50 speakers)
    * Most of the remaining languages are endangered.
    * (Exact level of endangerment hard to determine)<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/222653993-fbe955de-de39-4a21-bcbf-f7fb4a06c0ca.png)<br>
* 8 languages have over 100 million speakers.
  * Mandarin, Spanish, English, Bengali, Hindi, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese
  * 2.4 billion speakers combined
  * Top 20 languages: 3.5 billion speakers or more

#### Case Study: North America
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/222654962-7ea38d79-2c32-48a2-845a-d6a9f4de2aa0.png)<br>
* Before European invasion:
  * 20 million Native Americans who spoke around 300 languages.
* Today:
  * 2 million Native Americans, 175 languages
  * Of these 175 languages:
    * 55 have less than 5 speakers = virtually extinct
    * 100 are endangered languages.
    * 20 Native American languages may survive, since they are spoken by children.

#### Case Study: Australia
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/222656281-5039bede-80ef-465e-94f9-05ac918fad8a.png)<br>
* Before European invasion:
  * 1 million Indigenous Australians, 500 languages.
* Today: 
  * 200 languages survive, all are endangered.
  * Only 20 of these are spoken by children.

---

* What does this mean?
  * About 90% of human languages are on the verge of being lost,
  * This is a worldwide crisis. 
  * America and Australia represent tragedies of language death.

### Language Shift and Language Death
* **Language Shift:** process by which a language community adopts another language
* **Language Death:** when the last speaker of a language dies.
* Language study by Crystal, 2000:
  * The study assumes that there are 6000 languages and 50% language loss in the next 100 years.
  * If this is true, 3000 languages will be lost over a period of 1200 months.
  * To meet that time frame, at least one language must die, on average, every two weeks or so.
#### Why should we care?
* **Because we need diversity.**
  * Human cultures are the result of human struggle, adversity, ingenuity, adaptation, and creativity.
  * Analogy to ecosystem diversity.  The ecological system and its residents are valuable in and of themselves.
  * Language is an integral part of culture and the loss of a language is a permanent loss to the cultures in which the language is embedded.
  * Each language expresses a unique realization of the human experience.<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/222658131-fa52993c-742b-4fe9-ba5d-039accead7ea.png)<br>
  * **Loss of diversity:**
    * Endangered languages as compared to endangered species.
* **Because languages express identity:**
  * Let's think about English dialects or your native language and its dialects.
  * Do you speak a non-standard variety of English?  Most people do!
  * Would it be better if your dialect didn't exist or if everyone switched to Standard English and your dialect was no longer spoken?
  * Are there features of your dialect that are interestingly different from Standard English?
  * If we think about English, people are often proud of their local accents.
  * An accent is a clear outward sign of identification with a particular place.
* **Because languages are repositories of history:**
  * "... and therefore I am always sorry when any language is lost, because language is the pedigree of nations." - Samuel Johnson
  * Any language is a window on history.
  * The lexicon can give us an idea of what people in the past encountered, for example.
  * For many languages, histories are only recorded in **spoken language.**
  * **Beowulf** is part of the English linguistic history.
    * The Old English is often completely opaque to modern speakers.
    * In the case of Beowulf, we have access to this ancient story because we have a written record of the story.
  * What if the language is not written down?
    * The world's languages are full of these histories.
    * As languages are lost, speakers lose access to part of their history.
* **Because languages contribute to the sum of human language:**
  * Each language is a repository of the shared and accumulated knowledge of speakers over centuries.
  * People around the world have a profound awareness of the flora and fauna, rocks, soils, climate cycles, etc. of their environment.
  * Imagine if after 1066, Battle of Hastings, that French had become the dominant language and English died out.
    * No Chaucer, Shakespeare, on to your favorite authors of today.
    * There are other Shakepseares, Chaucers, Clancys, etc. Their stories are told in languages most people don't know.
* **Because languages are interesting in themselves:**
  * Languages are incredibly complex manifestations of the human mind.
  * Although language does not determine thought, the properties of language reflect properties of the mind.
  * Loss of a language is a loss of a chance to understand something profoundly and uniquely human.

## Language Death
### Why do languages die?
* **Factors which put people in physical danger:**
  * Natural disasters leading to death or destruction of habitat
  * Disease
  * Economic exploitation
  * Political conflict leading to civil war, ethnic murder, or genocide
* **Factors which change the people's culture:**
  * Cultural assimilation
  * Military dominance
  * Urbanization
  * Media
  * Bilingualism

### Stages of Assimilation
* **Pressure on people to speak dominant language:**
  * Results in emerging bilingualism in children.
* **Younger generation shifts to dominant language:**
  * Results in shame at using the minority language.
  * Leads to self-conscious semilingualism
  * Leads to dominant language monolingualism
* **One generation later:**
  * Discovery of what has been lost.
  * Perhaps too late

### Forced Assimilation
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/222669625-0514ec6a-6866-440e-a7b7-7ec1d2910693.png)<br>
* **Native American languages in schools:**
  * In the USA, Canada, and Australia there were residential or boarding schools where native children were sent.
* **Comparing Language Shift and Language Death**
  * Language death is similar to language shift in that it's a gradual process.
  * Functions of one language are taken over in one domain after another by another language.
  * Language death is manifested as a gradual loss of fluency by its speakers; competence gradually erodes over time.
  * Language shift is almost **inevitable** without active **language maintenance**.
  * Thinking that a language is no longer needed or that it is in any danger of disappearing may result in language loss.
  * **Rapid shift** occurs when speakers are eager to "fit in" or "get on" in society.

### Preventing Language Shift and Death
* What can we do to prevent language death or shift?
  * Understand factors that affect language shift in the first place.
  1. Accept the idea of **linguistic diversity** in the dominant culture.
      * Applies to dialects of a language as well as minority languages.
  2. Patterns of language use: **Socio-economic factors**
      * The more domains a minority language is used in, the more chances there is to maintain it.
  3. **Demographic factors:**
      * Large enough community of speakers
      * The community is able to isolate itself from the influences of the majority
      * Isolated rural communities of minorities tend to resist language shift, e.g., Pennsylvania Dutch
      * Improved roads, buses, TV, telephone, internet are agents of language shift.
      * Intermarriage can accelerate language shift towards language of partner who speaks majority language, unless multilingualism is the norm in society.
  4. **Attitudes to the minority language by speakers of it:**
      * Pride and respect of the language:
        * Language shift is faster in communities where the ethnic language is not highly valued. **Linguistics can help!**
      * Symbol of the ethnic identity:
        * Language shift is less likely to occur or proceeds more slowly when the ethnic language is seen as a symbol of identity.
        * Language is an important component of identity and culture. Maintaining a group's identity and culture is important to them, they maintain their ethnic language to maintain their identity.
  5. **Speakers of endangered/minority languages must have a say in the educational system.** 
      * Show that the language can be used in education, such as the creation of bilingual educational materials.
      * Training of native speakers as teachers.
      * Creation of language materials that are easy to use.
      * Development of written literature, both traditional and new.
  6. **Speakers of endangered/minority languages should have access to electronic technology.**
      * Allows speakers of minority languages to be in contact with each other.

# Summary
* What are the distinct potential outcomes from extended language contact situations?
* **Borrowing:**
  * Words, grammar, syntax, sounds
* **Language Creation:**
  * Pidgins:
    * Grammatically simplified systems
  * Creoles:
    * Fully expressive languages with native speakers
    * All creoles originate as pidgins
### Pidgins and Creoles
* Pidgins and creoles have properties in common
* Phonetics/Phonology (consonant cluster reduction).
  * Little inflection or affixation, but these can be found in creoles, never in pidgins
* SVO word order, but pidgins, which have no native speakers, tend to have more flexible word order
* Creoles have fully developed tense systems
* Pidgins tend to tolerate much more grammatical variation than creoles, which do have native speakers
* Even though similar, pidgins and creoles are distinct results of language contact.
### Language Endangerment and Death
* We are facing a worldwide **language extinction crisis**.
* This crisis is more severe and immediate than the ecological extinction crises we are facing.
* Many of the world's languages (optimistically ~50%) will cease to be spoken in the coming years.
* This is a loss for everyone.
* Language death is **not inevitable**.
* We can do something about it!
