# Week 8

## Language Contact
### Endangerment and Death
* This occurs when people no longer speak a particular language.
* Usually, it's because they adopt another language.
  * Not because the population that spoke the language died off.

### Scale of Langauge Loss (Ethnologue)
* Number of anguages in the world: 6912
* 347 languages (~5%) have over a million speakers.
* 94% of world population speaks one of these languages.
* The remaining 95% of languages are spoken by 6% of the world population.
  * Of these 95%:
    * 497 languages (~7%) are "nearly extinct" (<50 speakers)
    * Most of the remaining languages are endangered.
    * (Exact level of endangerment hard to determine)<br>

* 8 languages have over 100 million speakers.
  * Mandarin, Spanish, English, Bengali, Hindi, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese
  * 2.4 billion speakers combined
  * Top 20 languages: 3.5 billion speakers or more

* Before European invasion:
  * 20 million Native Americans who spoke around 300 languages.
* Today:
  * 2 million Native Americans, 175 languages
  * Of these 175 languages:
    * 55 have less than 5 speakers = virtually extinct
    * 100 are endangered languages.
    * 20 Native American languages may survive, since they are spoken by children.

#### Case Study: Australia

* Before European invasion:
  * 1 million Indigenous Australians, 500 languages.
* Today: 
  * 200 languages survive, all are endangered.
  * Only 20 of these are spoken by children.

* What does this mean?
  * About 90% of human languages are on the verge of being lost,
  * This is a worldwide crisis. 
  * America and Australia represent tragedies of language death.

### Language Shift and Language Death
* **Language Shift:** process by which a language community adopts another language
* **Language Death:** when the last speaker of a language dies.
* Language study by Crystal, 2000:
  * The study assumes that there are 6000 languages and 50% language loss in the next 100 years.
  * If this is true, 3000 languages will be lost over a period of 1200 months.
  * To meet that time frame, at least one language must die, on average, every two weeks or so.
#### Why should we care?
* **Because we need diversity.**
  * Human cultures are the result of human struggle, adversity, ingenuity, adaptation, and creativity.
  * Analogy to ecosystem diversity.  The ecological system and its residents are valuable in and of themselves.
  * Language is an integral part of culture and the loss of a language is a permanent loss to the cultures in which the language is embedded.
  * Each language expresses a unique realization of the human experience.<br>

  * **Loss of diversity:**
    * Endangered languages as compared to endangered species.
* **Because languages express identity:**
  * Let's think about English dialects or your native language and its dialects.
  * Do you speak a non-standard variety of English?  Most people do!
  * Would it be better if your dialect didn't exist or if everyone switched to Standard English and your dialect was no longer spoken?
  * Are there features of your dialect that are interestingly different from Standard English?
  * If we think about English, people are often proud of their local accents.
  * An accent is a clear outward sign of identification with a particular place.
* **Because languages are repositories of history:**
  * "... and therefore I am always sorry when any language is lost, because language is the pedigree of nations." - Samuel Johnson
  * Any language is a window on history.
  * The lexicon can give us an idea of what people in the past encountered, for example.
  * For many languages, histories are only recorded in **spoken language.**
  * **Beowulf** is part of the English linguistic history.
    * The Old English is often completely opaque to modern speakers.
    * In the case of Beowulf, we have access to this ancient story because we have a written record of the story.
  * What if the language is not written down?
    * The world's languages are full of these histories.
    * As languages are lost, speakers lose access to part of their history.
* **Because languages contribute to the sum of human language:**
  * Each language is a repository of the shared and accumulated knowledge of speakers over centuries.
  * People around the world have a profound awareness of the flora and fauna, rocks, soils, climate cycles, etc. of their environment.
  * Imagine if after 1066, Battle of Hastings, that French had become the dominant language and English died out.
    * No Chaucer, Shakespeare, on to your favorite authors of today.
    * There are other Shakepseares, Chaucers, Clancys, etc. Their stories are told in languages most people don't know.
* **Because languages are interesting in themselves:**
  * Languages are incredibly complex manifestations of the human mind.
  * Although language does not determine thought, the properties of language reflect properties of the mind.
  * Loss of a language is a loss of a chance to understand something profoundly and uniquely human.

## Language Death
### Why do languages die?
* **Factors which put people in physical danger:**
  * Natural disasters leading to death or destruction of habitat
  * Disease
  * Economic exploitation
  * Political conflict leading to civil war, ethnic murder, or genocide
* **Factors which change the people's culture:**
  * Cultural assimilation
  * Military dominance
  * Urbanization
  * Media
  * Bilingualism

### Stages of Assimilation
* **Pressure on people to speak dominant language:**
  * Results in emerging bilingualism in children.
* **Younger generation shifts to dominant language:**
  * Results in shame at using the minority language.
  * Leads to self-conscious semilingualism
  * Leads to dominant language monolingualism
* **One generation later:**
  * Discovery of what has been lost.
  * Perhaps too late

### Forced Assimilation

* **Native American languages in schools:**
  * In the USA, Canada, and Australia there were residential or boarding schools where native children were sent.
* **Comparing Language Shift and Language Death**
  * Language death is similar to language shift in that it's a gradual process.
  * Functions of one language are taken over in one domain after another by another language.
  * Language death is manifested as a gradual loss of fluency by its speakers; competence gradually erodes over time.
  * Language shift is almost **inevitable** without active **language maintenance**.
  * Thinking that a language is no longer needed or that it is in any danger of disappearing may result in language loss.
  * **Rapid shift** occurs when speakers are eager to "fit in" or "get on" in society.

### Preventing Language Shift and Death
* What can we do to prevent language death or shift?
  * Understand factors that affect language shift in the first place.
  1. Accept the idea of **linguistic diversity** in the dominant culture.
      * Applies to dialects of a language as well as minority languages.
  2. Patterns of language use: **Socio-economic factors**
      * The more domains a minority language is used in, the more chances there is to maintain it.
  3. **Demographic factors:**
      * Large enough community of speakers
      * The community is able to isolate itself from the influences of the majority
      * Isolated rural communities of minorities tend to resist language shift, e.g., Pennsylvania Dutch
      * Improved roads, buses, TV, telephone, internet are agents of language shift.
      * Intermarriage can accelerate language shift towards language of partner who speaks majority language, unless multilingualism is the norm in society.
  4. **Attitudes to the minority language by speakers of it:**
      * Pride and respect of the language:
        * Language shift is faster in communities where the ethnic language is not highly valued. **Linguistics can help!**
      * Symbol of the ethnic identity:
        * Language shift is less likely to occur or proceeds more slowly when the ethnic language is seen as a symbol of identity.
        * Language is an important component of identity and culture. Maintaining a group's identity and culture is important to them, they maintain their ethnic language to maintain their identity.
  5. **Speakers of endangered/minority languages must have a say in the educational system.** 
      * Show that the language can be used in education, such as the creation of bilingual educational materials.
      * Training of native speakers as teachers.
      * Creation of language materials that are easy to use.
      * Development of written literature, both traditional and new.
  6. **Speakers of endangered/minority languages should have access to electronic technology.**
      * Allows speakers of minority languages to be in contact with each other.
# Summary
* We are facing a worldwide **language extinction crisis**.
* This crisis is more severe and immediate than the ecological extinction crises we are facing.
* Many of the world's languages (optimistically ~50%) will cease to be spoken in the coming years.
* This is a loss for everyone.
* Language death is **not inevitable**.
* We can do something about it!
