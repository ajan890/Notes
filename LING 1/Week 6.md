# Week 6
## Syntax
### Introduction
<strong>Syntax</strong> is the study of how phrases and sentences are constructed.<br>
* There are many similarities between word construction in morphology and larger sentence structures in syntax.<br>

### Approaches to Sentence Structure
* There are two approaches to sentence structure.
  1. Words in a sentence are similar to links in a chain, or beads on a string.
    * They are **ordered linearly**, with no internal structure or hierarchy.
  2. Words in a sentence do have **internal structure**; some words are most closely connected than others.
    * Some words might "work together" in certain operations, whereas others would not.

* Are words simply beads on a string?
  > "Ian ran **up the hill.**"<br>
  > "Ian ran **up the bill.**"<br>
  * From a linear perspective, these two sentences look nearly identical.
  * The bolded string seem like they should behave similarly, but they don't.
    * "Up the hill" and "up the bill" have very different meanings.  You can only use the first to answer the question "Did Ian run?"
  * Words that are related often "move together" in certain constructions:
    > "It was **up the hill** that Ian ran." <br>
    > \*"It was **up the bill** that Ian ran." (incorrect)<br>
  * So why do they behave differently?<br>
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/220809637-e44caa50-5e35-4b16-a021-2951eea0771a.png)<br>
  * Consider the way you "chunk" up the words.
    * "Up the hill" behaves differently compared to "Up the bill"
    * "Up the hill" seems to function as a unit in a way that "up the bill" does not.
  * This example shows that there <em>is</em> in fact internal structure.

## Constituents
* Words are grouped into units called **constituents**.
* Sometimes more than one "grouping" might be possible.
  > "City to add twelve foot cops"<br>
  * Does the city hire twelve cops that walk around, or twelve-foot tall cops?<br>

### Infinitely extended length
* Constituents/units can be infinitely extended in length:
  > "Joe bought **a car.**"<br>
  > "Joe bought **an old car.**"<br>
  > "Joe bought **a dirty old car from the man down the street.**"<br>
  > "Joe bought **a dirty old car for $40 from the man down the street.**"<br>
* All the bolded phrases are appropriate answers to question: "What did Joe buy?"

### Word Order
#### Word order is constrained:
  > "I went to the grocery store to buy a gallon of milk." (Correct)<br> 
  > \*"Grocery gallon milk went I store buy to the to a of." (Incorrect)<br>
#### Basic word order varies greatly across languages
  * **English** basic word order: Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)
  * **Tatar** basic word order: Subject-Object-Verb (SOV)
  * **ASL** basic word order: Verb-Subject-Object (VSO)
#### Word order in meaningless sentences:
  * Word order matters, even when dealing with sentences that don't have "real" meaning:
    > "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously." (Meaningless, but syntatically correct)<br>
    > "Green furiously sleep ideas colorless." (Meaningless, but not syntatically correct)<br>
  * Both of these two sentences are **meaningless**, but the first sentence is syntatically and grammatically correct while the second is not.
  * Grammatical != Understandable
#### Similar building blocks across languages
  * Sentences across languages are built using the same **syntatic categories**:
    * Nouns, Verbs (all languages have them)
    * Adjectives, Adverbs, Conjunctions, Articles, Prepositions, etc. (not all languages have them)
### Identifying the Syntatic Categories
  > Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana."<br>
  * What is the category of "flies"?
  * What about "like"?
* The traditional approach is that you determine syntatic categores by looking at the meaning.
  * **Verb** = action or state of being
  * **Noun** = person, place, thing
  * **Adjective** = modifier that expresses quality, quantity, or extent
* But what about when meaning isn't enough to determine a word's syntactic category?
  * "The **assassination** of the senator" (Noun that expresses an action)
  * "**Annoy**" vs. "**Piss off**" vs. "**Infuriate**" (similar verbs, but express different extent)
* <strong>Behavioral Approach</strong>
  * We determine a word's syntactic category by looking at how it **behaves**, and not just what it **means.**
  * A word **is** what it **does**.
  * "A noun... is simply a word that does nouny things." - Steven Pinker, in <em>The Language Instinct</em>
  * Which words are nouns? Verbs? How do you know?
    * You know by the <em>distribution</em> of the word.
* <strong>Categories of Made-Up Words</strong>
  * What is your intuition about the syntatic categories of "toves," "slithy," and "outgrabe?"
  * Our intuition tells us "toves" must be a noun.  But why do we have this intuition if we don't know the word?

* <strong>Word Category Tests</strong>
  * A word that can follow a definite article, indefinite article, numeral, <em>which</em> phrase, or a possessor (genitive) is a noun.
  * To test if "book" is a noun:
    > 1. **the** book = Definite determiner<br>
    > 2. **a** book = Indefinite determiner<br>
    > 3. **six** books = Numbers<br>
    > 4. **which** book = <em>Which</em> phrase<br>
    > 5. **Mary's** books = Possesor/genitive<br>
  * A word that can combine with the tense suffixes (-s, -ing, -ed, etc.) is a verb.
  * To test if "wipe" is a verb:
    > 1. "She wip**ed** the table clean."<br>
    > 2. "He wipe**s** his glasses constantly."<br>
  * To test adjectives:
    * A item that can appear in the position following "seems" or "seems" is an adjective:
      > \_\_\_\_ seems \_\_\_\_
    * If -er or -est can be added to the word, or if the word can follow <em>more</em> or <em>most</em>, then it is an adjective.
  * To test if "happy" is an adjective:
    > "He seems **happy.**
    > Happ**ier**, Happ**iest**
    > **More** happy, the **most** happy

#### Types of Categories
> N - Noun = Erin, cake, liberty, water<br>
> V - Verb = sing, walk, create<br>
> P - Preposition = to, about, with, in, without<br>
> Adj - Adjective = funny, orange, impossible<br>
> Adv - Adverb = quickly, fast, unfortunately, sheepishly, yesterday, very<br>
> Aux - Auxiliary = have, had, be, was, were<br>
> Mod - Modal = can, may, will, might, could<br>
> Det - Determiner/Article = a, an, the, those<br>

### Constituency - Subject/Auxiliary Inversion
* What is the subject of these two sentences?
  > "I ate a rutabaga"<br>
  > "The little manatee ate a rutabaga"<br>
* "I" is a single word while "the little manatee" is a string of words, but they play the same role in these sentences.
* We call chunks like "the little manatee" **constituents** - natural groupings of words within a sentence.
* "I" and "the little manatee" are each a constituent.  How can we see this directly?
* To form a question from the statement above, the subject and auxiliary verb "invert" positions.
  > "Will **I** eat a rutabaga?"<br>
  > "Will **the little manatee** eat a rutabaga?"<br>
* "The little manatee" acts as if it is a single unit, even though we can clearly see that it's composed of multiple words.
* What happens when multiple auxiliaries are present? Let's check.
  > "The little manatee **has been eating** a rutabaga."<br>
  > "**Has** the little manatee \_\_\_ **been eating** a rutabaga?" (correct)<br>
  > \*"**Been** the little manatee **has** \_\_\_ **eating** a rutabaga?" (incorrect)<br>
  > \*"**Eating** the little manatee **has been** \_\_\_ a rutabaga?" (incorrect)<br>
* Thus, only **the first auxiliary inverts with the subject**.
* What happens in the sentence: 
  > "The little rabbit that **has** hopped **will** eat a rutabaga."<br>
  * Let's invert the first auxiliary:
    > \*"**Has** the little rabbit that \_\_\_ hopped **will** eat a rutabaga?" (incorrect)<br>
  * We inverted the first auxiliary, but it's ungrammatical.
  * Instead, we have to move "will":
    > "**Will** the little rabbit that **has** hopped \_\_\_ eat a rutabaga?<br>
  * It turns out that the entire string "**the little rabbit that has hopped**" acts as a single unit, even though it contains a number of words.
  * **The first auxiliary after the subject inverts with the subject.**
  * Crucially, we have to refer to structural notions like "**subject**."

### Determining Constituency
* Even though we have not been taught, we have intuitions about what counts as a constituent or a unit of the syntax.
* This kind of knowledge is part of native speakers' knowledge of the language.
* There are multiple luinguistic tests that we can use to test to see whether or not a given string of words is a constituent.
  * Replacement tests
  * Stand alone tests
  * Movement tests
* It is necessary to perform multiple tests; one failed test is not enough to give up.
* Basic principles:
  * Every **sentence** is a constituent
  * Every **word** is a constituent
#### Replacement Tests
**Replacement:** There are two types of replacement.<br>
1. **Pronoun Replacement Test** (Targets noun phrases)
  * Many constituents can be replaced by pronouns such as **I**, **he**, **she**, **you**, **we**, **their**
  * When a group of words can be replaced by a pronoun, and...
    * ...the resulting sentence is **grammatical**,
    * ...the resyktubg sebtebce has the **same meaning.**
  * ...then the **group of words being replaced is a constituent.**
  * Successful pronoun replacement:
    > "I found **the puppy** at the park."<br>
    > "I found **him** at the park."<br>

    > "The **esteemed senator** greeted **the governor of Michigan**.<br>
    > "The esteemed senator greeted **him**.<br>
    > "**She** greeted the governor of Michigan."<br>
    > "**She** greeted **him**."<br>

    > "**The old blind man** found **the suitcase full of money.**"<br>
    > "**He** found **it**."<br>

2.  **"Do So/Do Too" Replacement Test** (Targets verb phrases)
  * If the string can be replaced by "do so"/"did so" or "do too"/"did too", then that string forms a constituent.
  * Test sentence:
    > "The old man **found a dollar**."<br>
    > "The old man **did so**.<br>
  * Therefore, "found a dollar" is a constituent.
  * More test sentences:
    > "She **went to the West Coast**."<br>
    > "She **did so**."<br>
    
    > "Julie **called the governor of Missouri.**"<br>
    > "Julie **did too**."<br>

#### Stand Alone Test
* A chunk of words that can stand on its own as an answer to a question is a constituent.
* Test sentence:
  > "The girl ran in the rain."<br>
* Successful stand alone tests:
  > Who ran in the rain? = "**The girl**"<br>
  > Where did the girl run? = "**In the rain**"<br>
* Failed stand alone test:
  > What happened in the rain? = \* "**Girl ran**" (incorrect)<br>

#### Movement Test
* When a group of words can be moved around within a sentence, it indicates that the group of words is a constituent.
* There are many types of movement tests, but we will concentrate on **fronting** and **clefting**.
* **Fronting:**
  * Moving a group of words to the beginning (or front) of a sentence.
  * If the resulting sentence is **grammatical** and has the **same basic meaning**, then the moved chunk is a constituent.
  * Successful fronting:
  * Examples:
    > "The girl ran **in the rain**."<br>
    > "**In the rain**, the girl ran."<br>

    > "Peter has pickled **hot peppers** in the kitchen."<br>
    > "**Hot peppers** Peter has pickled in the kitchen."<br>

    > "Jane might chase **the bluebirds** tomorrow."<br>
    > "**The bluebirds** Jane might chase tomorrow."<br>
   * Failed fronting:
      > \*"**Bluebirds tomorrow**, Jane might chase the." (incorrect)<br>
      > \*"**Chase the**, Jane might bluebirds tomorrow." (incorrect)<br>

#### Clefting
* **Clefting** involves breaking up a sentence and feeding it into the following formula:
* "It is/was \_\_\_\_ that \_\_\_\_." 
* Example:
  > "The girl ran in the rain."<br>
  > "It was in the rain that the girl ran."<br>
  > "It was the girl that ran in the rain."<br>
  > "It was girl ran that the in the rain."<br>

## Constituency Tests to Trees
* All English sentences must contain (minimally) a noun and a verb.
* This generalization can describe the structure of very simple English sentence:
  > "John slept" <br>
* Most sentences, even very simple ones, are more complex:
  > "The cat slept on the mat" (Det + N + V + P + Det + N)<br>
* A + B + C + D + E is linear, it does not reflect constituency.
* Both "John slept" and "The cat slept on the mat" can be divided into two parts:
  * A constituent that acts like a **noun**. 
  * A constituent that acts like a **verb**.
    > **"The dog slept."**<br>
  * Pronoun replacement:
    > "It slept." (Replaces the dog)<br>

    > **"The dog slept on the mat."**<br>
  * Pronoun replacement:
    > "It slept on the mat." (Replaces the dog)<br>
    > "The dog slept there." (Replaces on the mat)<br>
  * Do so replacement:
    > "Yes, the dog did so." (Replace slept on the mat)<br>

* These constituents can be mapped to a tree.
* Pronoun replacement:
  > "The young man bought **them**."<br>
  > "**He** bought several large crabs."<br>
* Do so replacement: 
  > "Yes, the young man **did so**."<br>
* Every sentence is a constituent.<br>
![3_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/220842648-a1318c01-e659-4208-a8df-2f06e63078b3.png)<br>

* In the sentences "John slept" and "The cat slept on the mat":
  * "John" and "the cat" takes the place of a noun; therefore, it is called a **noun phrase (NP)**.
  * "slept" and "slept on the mat" takes the place of the verb; therefore, it is called a **verb phrase (VP)**.<br>
![6_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/220843418-ebe1be07-7050-4d1d-b57a-580b53029a62.png)<br>

## Phrase Structure Rules
* All English sentences follow a similar pattern.
* We can express this generalization by writing what is known as a phrase structure rule:
  > **S→ NP VP**<br>
* This states that a sentence contain two distinct parts: a noun phrase (NP) and a verb phrase (VP).

### Noun Phrase Rules
* **Noun phrase (NP):**
  * NP (DET) (Adj) N (PP) "The cute dog on the couch."
  * An NP can be inserted into a sentence in a position which requires a noun.
  * Examples of NPs:
    > "Larry"<br>
    > "the Alpo"<br>
    > "a yellow butterfly"<br>
    > "the tall woman by the pool"<br>
* NPs are interchangeable in sentences. Where an NP appears in a sentence, you can put in another NP.
* Example:
  > "John ate a chocolate pie."<br>
  > "He", "she" and "it" are all NPs. If you can replace a constituent with a pronoun, that constituent is an NP.<br>
* Pronoun replacement targets NPs.
* Successful pronoun replacement tests reveal a constituent, and tell you what kind of constituent you're dealing with.

### Verb Phrase Rules
* **Verb phrase (VP): → V (NP) (PP) (Adv) VP**
* A VP can be inserted into a sentence in a position which requires a verb.
* Examples of VPs:
  > "ran"<br>
  > "runs in the park"<br>
  > "hit a ball"<br>
  > "fell slowly into the bath"<br>
  > "fell into the bath slowly"<br>
* Check using your constituency tests:
  > "The puppy ran in the park."<br>
  > "Yes, the puppy did so."<br>
* Conclusion:
  * "Ran in the park" is a Verb Phrase constituent.
* Like NPs, VPs are **interchangeable**. Do so/too is a VP.
* If you can replace a constituent with do so/too or did so/too, that constituent is a VP!
  * Do so/too replacement targets VPs.
  * A successful do/did replacement test reveals a constituent, and tells you what kind of constituent you're dealing with.

### Prepositional Phrases
* **Prepositional Phrase (PP):**
* **PP → Prep (NP)** (A preposition followed by an NP)
* Examples of PPs:
  > "to the store"<br>
  > "with any luck"<br>
  > "from Abby"<br>
  > "looked up"<br>

## Phrase Structure Trees
* **Syntactic trees** allow us to see/encode the constituency of a sentence directly:<br>
![14_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/220844485-b446a7bb-7116-453f-ab08-9a2c500edf1e.png)<br>
  > "Yes, the spider **did so**."<br>

### How To Draw Them
* When we use trees to represent sentence structure, we must do two things:
  1. Accurately represent word order.
  2. Identify constituents.
  * Example: "up the stairs."
    * Step 1: Determiner and noun join to form an NP.
    * Step 2: The P and NP join to form the PP.<br>
![15_image (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/220847811-39215cba-be6c-49f1-a707-3bc3867d57f6.png)<br>
* Phrase structure trees are like blueprints for a sentence.
* They can show us:
  * How sentences are built.
  * How they can be broken down into pieces.
* **Phrase structure rules** determine how to break down those pieces.
* We can use PS rules to help us figure out how our trees should look!<br>
![16_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/220844819-d60d8a47-3e6e-4622-8e86-657901d199e6.png)<br>
* Where do these trees/constituent structures come from? 
* How do speakers correctly structure their utterances?
  * The leading hypothesis: speakers appeal to **unconscious/internalized** phrase structure rules.
  * Part of your knowledge of your native language:
    * You know phrase structure rules that enable you to make hierarchical constituent structures effortlessly.

### Phrase Structure Rules - Recap
* All English sentences must minimally contain: A noun phrase (subject) A verb phrase (predicate)
* We can express this generalization by writing a phrase structure rule (or "PS rule", for short):
* **S→ NP VP**
  > [(S)[(NP) Mary] [(VP) laughed]]<br>
  > Person A: "Mary laughed."<br>
  > Person B: "Yes, Mary did so."<br>

* Below are a few more example trees.

> ![18_example3_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/220846669-55a60a46-9555-454e-aaf3-1beea17f335f.png)<br>

* **Phrase Structure Rules:**
* **S → NP VP **
  > "The cat slept."<br>
* **NP → (DET) (Adj) N (PP)**
  > "(The) (cute) dog (on the couch)."<br>
* **VP → V (NP) (PP) (Adv)**
  > "Read (the book) (quickly)."<br>
* **PP → Prep (NP)**
  > "at (home)"; "up"; "down"<br>

### Terminology
* There is a special terminology used to define relationships between elements in a phrase structure tree.
* This terminology makes it easier to talk about how the elements in a tree are related to one another.
#### Node:
  * A labeled branch point, where the syntactic category is labeled.<br>
![20_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/220849397-0f0672ec-c45d-4dbf-b1fa-c785fbf409b6.png)<br>

#### Domination: Every higher node dominates all the categories beneath it.
  * When a continuous downward path can be traced from a node labeled X to a node labeled Y, then X dominates Y.
  * In the tree below, **PP** dominates **Prep**, **NP**, **DET**, **N**.<br>
![21_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/220849533-3b1144ca-b85d-453c-a7f7-ae660f772bbb.png)<br>

#### Sisters: Two categories that are directly under the same node are called sisters.
  * In the above example, **DET** and **N** are sisters.

* Example: <br>
![23_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/220849917-d68bb5c3-dc64-41d3-aab5-1e432ff1ad0e.png)<br>
  * What are the nodes of this tree? 
    * S, NP1, VP, DET, N, V, PP, P, NP2, DET2, N2
  * What are the pairs of sisters in this tree? 
    * (NP1, VP), (DET, N), (V, PP), (P, NP2), (DET2, N2)
  * What does VP dominate?
    * V, PP, P, NP2, DET2, N2
* The head of a phrase is the lexical item which determines its syntactic category (and name):
  * **NP:**
    > "an extinct bird species of South America"<br>
    > "Martha."<br>
  * **PP:**
    > "of all shapes and sizes" "before the end of the day"<br>
  * **VP:**
    > "bring buckets of water" "eliminate the losing team"<br>
    > The head of an NP is always an N. The head of a VP is always a V.<br>
  * Etc...


#### Complement: Gives some added information about the head.
  * Complements will be **sisters** to the head.
  * What's the head of the VP below? What's the complement?<br>
![25_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/220850969-87a23b0f-c0d2-40a6-87e0-92ca8fde7f44.png)<br>
* Every category can have a complement.
* The complement may be another phrase with another head inside of it:
* **PP:** 
  > "before [the end [of the day]]"
* NP:
  > "The destruction [of Rome]"
* VP:
  > "bring [buckets [of water]]" "work [at home]"
* **All phrases must have heads.**
* **A head may or may not have complements.**
  * "... the verb 'laughed' does not have a complement." -Harold Torrence (UCLA put this in their powerpoint so it's here now.) <br>

# Summary
* Words come in **syntactic categories**.
* Traditional methods of determining nouns, verbs, and adjectives do **not** work, meaning alone is not sufficient to determine the category of a word.
* There are a number of tests we can do to determine each word's category.
* Strings of words form chunks that are called **constituents**.
  * There are a number of tests we can use to determine constituency.
    * Constituency tests
    * Phrase structure rules
  * How to go from **constituency tests** to **phrase structure trees**
* Some technical notions associated with phrase structure trees
