# Week 2
## Language Variations

### Dialect Differences
Is the way that any one person or group of people speak better than anyone else's?<br>
Are there any differences between the following greeting?<br>
  > "How are you doing?"<br>
  > "How are you?"<br>
  > "How ya doin'?"<br>
  > "What's up?"<br>
  > "Whazz up?"<br>
Which of these would you most likely use with:<br>
  * A sibling?<br>
  * A friend?<br>
  * Your professor?<br>
  * Your grandmother?<br>
  * The Queen of England?<br>
This goes to show that none of them are wrong; you just use them in different situations.<br>
The same goes with language in general; there is no "better" or "worse" way to speak.<br>

### What is a Dialect?
The <strong>popular understanding</strong> goes as follows:<br>
  * A <strong>dialect</strong> is a type of pseudo-language spoken by uneducated or country people.<br>
    * Only the speech of socially disfavored groups is "dialect."<br>
    * Those who speak the language "correctly" do not speak "dialect."<br>
  * In popular speech, dialect just refers to speech that is different from one's own speech.<br>
  * Dialect is also commonly conceived of as a corrupt form of the "correct" language.  It is <em>derived</em> from the "correct" form.<br>
  * The common conception is that dialects represent unsuccessful attempts to speak the standard language.<br>
    * In reality, children acquire the speech of their communities.<br>
  * Unlike the standard language, dialects are often perceived as lacking grammatical rules.<br>
    * In reality, all dialects (like all language systems) are regular and rule governed.<br>
  * <strong>This popular definition is WRONG!</strong><br>

The <strong>linguistic definition</strong> goes as follows:<br>
* A <strong>dialect</strong> refers to any variety of a language that si shared by a group of speakers.<br>
  * So, <strong>everyone</strong> speaks a dialect of their language.<br>
  * From this perspective, there is no such thing as a "good" or "bad" or "better" or "worse" dialect.<br>
  * In fact, a <strong>language</strong> is a <strong>collection of dialects</strong>, one of which has been adopted as the <strong>standard variety</strong>, which people think of as "the language."<br>
    * The standard variety is simply one dialect of a language.  For a variety of historical and social reasons, this dialect may end up being the "standard."<br>

### Characteristics of a Standard Language
<strong>Selection:</strong><br>
* The dialect of the ruling or most influential class is adopted as the standard.<br>

<strong>Literacy:</strong><br>
* It acquires a written form.<br>

<strong>Standardization:</strong><br>
* A grammar that provides the "rules" of the language.<br>

<strong>Authoritative dictionary:</strong><br>
* Such as Oxford English Dictionary.<br>

<strong>Spelling/writing is fixed:</strong><br>
* If there are competing grammatical or spelling forms, one is adopted as correct and the other(s) are deemed incorrect.<br>

<strong>A "correct" pronunciation.</strong><br>

<strong>Public Life:</strong><br>
* Taught in schools, used in official transactions.<br>

### Prestige Dialects
One dialect is often considered a <strong>prestige dialect</strong> while others are considered <strong>"substandard."</strong>.<br>

Prestige dialects are often associated with positive attributes:<br>
* Education level<br>
* Sophistication<br>
* Intelligence<br>
* etc.<br>

Substandard dialects are often associated with the reverse:<br>
* Ignorance<br>
* Lack of Education<br>
* Lack of Intelligence<br>
* Laziness<br>
* etc.<br>

### Understanding Variation
Language is used differently in different contexts.<br>
* We may all be speakers of English but may be speakers of somewhat different dialects.<br>
* For instance, which of the following terms do you use?<br>
  > 1. Do you put groceries in a bag, a sack, or a poke?<br>
  > 2. Pepsi, Dr. Pepper, Sprite, etc. are all types of soda, pop, soda pop, tonic, or coke?<br>
  > 3. On summer nights, do children catch fireflies, lightning bugs, fire bugs, or glow worms?<br>

### Different Criterias
Language varies according to:<br>
1. Geography<br>
2. Social class<br>
3. Political ideology<br>
4. Age<br>
5. Gender<br>
6. Sexual orientation<br>
7. Situation<br>
8. Time<br>

### Geographic Variation
* If variation is based on geographical origin, we talk about regional or <strong>geographical dialects</strong>.<br>
* If variation is based on social background, we talk about <strong>social dialects</strong>.<br>

<strong>Example:</strong> What do you call it when rain falls and the sun is shining?<br>
> “I have no term or expression for this”<br>
> “Sunshower”<br>
> “The devil is beating his wife<br>
> Other<br>

<strong>Example:</strong> What do you call the act of covering a house in a roll of toilet paper?<br>
> “Tp’ing”<br>
> “Toilet papering”<br>
> “Other”<br>
> I have no word for this<br>

<strong>Example:</strong> What is your generic term for a sweetened, carbonated beverage?<br>
> “Soda”<br>
> “Pop”<br>
> “Coke”<br>
> Other<br>

<strong>Example:</strong> What do you use to address a group of two or more people<br>
> “You guys”<br>
> “You”<br>
> “Y’all“<br>
> Other<br>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/213944094-c3b99122-a54e-4d0c-a4a1-c1a66aac71ad.png)<br>

### Differences in Language Between Countries
Some countries use different words to describe the same concepts.<br>
<strong>Example: </strong>British English -> American English:<br>
> Braces -> Suspenders<br>
> Loo -> Bathroom<br>
> Brawn -> Head Cheese<br>

<strong>Example: </strong>In Spanish, there are a lot of variations for the same word in English.<br>
Spanish variations for <em>popcorn</em>:<br>
> alepa; copos de maiz; maíz frito; maíz pira; cocaleca; pipocas; pochoclos; palomitas (de maiz), canguil; pop; popcorn; poporopo; pororó; rosas; roscas.<br>

Spanish variations for <em>bus</em>:<br>
> autobús, guagua, camión, empresa.<br>

### Variation Based on Race and Ethnicity
<em>African American Vernacular English</em> (AAVE)<br>
* A sociolinguistic focus on AAVE arose in part because the civil rights movement and integration of schools brought dialectal variation into the spotlight<br>
* It led to dialogue about how best to teach children who speak a different dialect<br>
* We are going to look at some of the linguistic rules governing AAVE, but you can think about this concept with regards to various educational settings<br>

<strong>Syntax: </strong>Do two negatives make a positive?<br>

<strong>Example:</strong> SAE -> AAVE:<br>
> “I don’t know anybody” -> “I don’t know nobody”<br>
> “I don’t have any idea” -> “I ain’t got no idea”<br>

<strong>Example:</strong> Spanish:<br>
> “No conozco a nadie.” (“I don’t know nobody”)<br>
> “No tengo ni idea.”  (“I don’t have no idea”)<br>

AAVE and Spanish exhibit “<strong>negative concord</strong>”<br>

<strong>Be-deletion</strong>:<br>
* Be is frequently deleted in AAVE<br>
* Based on the data seen below, can you determine a rule that governs be-deletion?<br>

<strong>Example:</strong> SAE -> AAVE<br>
> “He’s nice” -> “He nice”<br>
> “They’re mine” -> “They mine”<br>
> “He’s as nice as he says he is” -> “He as nice as he say he is”<br>
> ”He’s as nice as he says he’s” -> ”He as nice as he say he.” <strong>(incorrect)</strong><br>
> “He’s not ready to go” -> “He say he not ready to go.”<br>

Just from this example, we can see that there is a direct correlation between SAE and AAVE:<br>

AAVE does be-deletion in the contexts where Standard English can do contraction of be.<br>
In the cases where AAVE cannot do be-deletion, Standard English can’t do contraction of be.<br>

<strong>AAVE Grammar Rules</strong><br>
* One common criticism of “dialects” is that they have no rules of “grammar.”<br>
* If there are no rules of grammar, then everything should be grammatical, right?<br>
* Is that what we saw in AAVE?<br>
  * No, there are sentences you cannot say in AAVE<br>

### Variations Based on Social Status
In 1989, Penelope Eckert conducted a study in a suburban high school in Detroit, focusing on two social groups:<br>
  * <strong>Jocks:</strong> Middle class background, establishment, extracurricular activities, school-based social life, intend to leave.<br>
  * <strong>Burnouts:</strong> Working class background, local friends, intent to stay, vocational training.<br>

Findings of the study: Percent <strong>negative concord</strong> among social groups:<br>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/213947203-d0bba9b6-c67b-43e8-aeaf-30d0e5679d55.png)<br>

<strong>"Negative Concord"</strong> means the usage of double/multiple negatives.<br>

<strong>Example:</strong><br>
> "I didn't see nobody"<br>

* The jock girls use “super-standard” grammar.<br>
* The burnout girls use the non-standard form at a similar rate as the burnout boys.<br>
* Burnout girls who are proud of their wildness, the “burned out burnouts”, have the highest use of the non-standard forms.<br>

<strong>Case study: Class-based Variation in Norwich: H-deletion in Norwich, England</strong><br>

* Instead of saying “He has”, someone may delete the “h”, and say “-e -as”<br>
* “He is here” -> “-e is -ere”.<br>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/213947340-5f841c15-8421-4a00-83aa-73dbea04f49d.png)<br>

<strong>Comparing use of 3rd singular -S</strong><br>
<strong>Observation:</strong><br>
Variation in use of standard 3rd singular present -s in verbs
<strong>Example:</strong><br>
> “She like_ him very much.” vs. “She likes him very much.”<br>
> “He doesn’t know a lot, do he?” vs. “He don’t know a lot, do he?”<br>

<strong>Experiment:</strong><br>
1. Recruit speaker from a community (Norwich, Detroit ..), ideally ones who have never left that community.<br>
2. Classify speakers according to social class.<br>
3. Elicit and record speech in one or more events. (Casual speech, word lists…)<br>
4. Count percentage of times each speaker users verbs with and without -s<br>

<strong>Hypothesis:</strong><br>
Variation between standard -s and non standard -∅ is conditioned by social factors (in this case, class)<br>

<strong>Results:</strong><br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/213951958-551768b7-953b-4a25-898a-2cb48568d40e.png)<br>

The variation does in fact have a correlation.<br>

### Dialect and Prestige
<strong>Notions of "Correctness"</strong><br>
* A standard variety of a language is often thought to be the “correct” form, as opposed to simply being one of the dialects of a language.<br>
* The standard language and speakers of the standard language are often associated with better education, higher intelligence, and a number of other positive traits that have nothing to do with the grammar or structure of a language.<br>
* The standard language has higher prestige.<br>

### Educational System
* The educational system teaches "correct" and "incorrect" grammar.<br>
* However, there is no such thing as "correct" and "incorrect" grammar.  It is correct as long as people accept it to be correct.<br>
* Thus, it is more accurate to say that the educational system teaches "correct" and "incorrect" grammar of the standard language.<br>

### Government
* Only the standard form of a language is used in official government business.<br>

### Social Class:
* Speakers often correlate linguistic properties with social variables like socio-economic status.<br>
* The speech/dialect from higher social classes is perceived as correct, or a sign of intelligence or good upbringing.<br>
* The speech/dialect associated with people low on the socio-economic ladder is judged to be inferior or a sigh of lack of intelligence, etc.<br>
* But, does intelligence really correlate with how much money you were born with? Or have?<br>

## Stigmatization
There are a number of “classic” stigmatized features found in American dialects:

<strong>Double Negation:</strong><br>
> “They didn’t say nothing”<br>

<strong>Regularized verb forms:</strong><br>
> “She growed up”<br>

<strong>Different subject-verb agreement patterns:</strong><br>
> “We was there.”<br>

It can be useful to think about how negative attitudes about dialects play out in an educational situation.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong><br>
Let’s take a look at a scene from Fish Bowl, which features use of Hawaiian Creole English, a dialect of English native to Hawai’i.  The movie is set in Hilo, Hawai’i, in the 1970’s.<br>
* (The teacher was making fun of the students for speaking Hawaiian English rather than Standard English.)<br>

### English Dialect Case Study - Singapore "Singlish"
* “Singlish” is a variety of English spoken in Singapore.<br>
* Singapore’s population is 5.6 million, and about 74% Chinese, 14% Malay, 9% Indian (Mostly Tamil), 3% other<br>
* Why is Singlish an interesting case study?<br>
  * Lots of native speakers<br>
  * Multilingual environment<br>
  * Language contact<br>
* Singapore has 4 official languages:<br>
  * Malay, Mandarin, Tamil, and English to reflect Singapore’s population.<br>
* Malay is the national language (Merely ceremonial today).<br>
* In practice, English is the de facto language of government and administration<br>
* Since 1987 English is the medium of education in schools.<br>
* English is crucial to the survival and success of Singapore in the global marketplace.<br>
* English is promoted as a “neutral language, not favoring of the major ethnic groups.<br>

<strong>Stigmatization</strong>
* As with most colloquial varieties of English, the use of Singlish is strongly stigmatized.<br>
* In 1999, the Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong states that Singlish was “English corrupted by Singaporeans” and was “broken, ungrammatical English”<br>
* The “Speak Good English” movement got started in 2000.<br>
* His “Speak Good English” movement actively discouraged the use of Singlish. (www.goodenglish.ord.sg)<br>
* “Good English” can be identified when:<br>
  * Verbs are marked as singular/plural, past tense, etc.<br>
	> (e.g. “Jenny loves oranges”, “We talked to him yesterday.”)<br>
  * Nouns are marked as singular/plural<br>
	> (e.g. “Khai Meng has two dogs.”)<br>
  * Endings like “lah”, “lor”, “leh”, “what” are not used, and very informal Singlish words are avoided. <br>
  > (e.g. “koyak”, “bochap”)<br>

<strong>Discourse Particles</strong>
* No direct <strong>sematic meaning</strong>, but serves a <strong>pragmatic function</strong>.<br>
* It changes tone of the sentence but not its grammatical and propositional meaning<br>
* Indicate speaker’s attitude<br>
* Feature of <strong>spoken</strong> singlish<br>

English has discourse particles too:<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/213953200-7b03f9fb-64b2-4669-9e08-2bf1d2f1847d.png)<br>

Some singlish discourse particles include "lah," "what," and "meh."

<strong>Consider the following:</strong><br>
> “There’s something here for everyone, <strong>lah</strong>.”<br>
* The added "lah" can show reassurance or impatience:<br>
  * It can mean both of the following, depending on the context:<br>
    > "Don't worry, there is enough things here to go around, everyone will receive something."<br>

    > "Can you stop questioning me, there is definitely enough things here to go around, everyone will receive something."<br>

---

> “No one parks here, <strong>what</strong>.”<br>
* The added "what" can show obviousness or contradiction:<br>
  * It can mean both of the following, depending on the context:<br>
    > "Haven;t I told you before already, nobody parks their vehicles at this spot/Didn't I tell you this spot will be empty?  And it is!"<br>
     
    > "You told me that this parking spot will be filled but apparently this spot is empty."<br>

---

>"You don't like me, <strong>meh</strong>?"
* The added "meh" can show surprise or skepticism.<br>
  * It can mean both of the following, depending on the context:<br>
    > "Are you sure you do not like that one?  I thought you did!"<br>
    
    > "Are you sure you do not like that one/  Do not lie to me."<br>

---

A quote of a man from a video (<em>Cooling-off Day</em>) giving monologue shows discourse particles in Spanish.  (The quote is translated.)<br>
> “I ever go to one of those meet-the-people session, I want to vomit halfway.  When he talk to you <strong>ah</strong> (indicates emphasis), I think something likem how to say <strong>ah</strong>? <strong>Kay kay</strong> (“pretend”) <strong>ah</strong>.  You know what I mean.  Make you happy only.  Make you <strong>shiok</strong> (“fantastic, wonderful”) only.  Talk-talk only <strong>lah</strong>, no action taken one. I go three four times already <strong>walau</strong>!”<br>

<strong>The takeaway: </strong>The presence of all the discourse particles do not make Singlish (or other variations of English) inferior to English.<br>

## Colloquial English Variation
### Case Study of the word "like"
* “Like” is not necessarily a marker of a particular dialect, but is used in many colloquial varieties of English.<br>
* Standard forms of “like”:<br>
  > Verb “like” as in “I like rutabagas.”<br>
  > Comparative “like” as in “Mary is like John”<br>
* Many critics of colloquial “llike” are concerned with the supposed deterioration of the English language.<br>
  * This is not new at all!<br>

* In 1712, Jonathan Swift wrote <em>A Proposal of Correcting, Improving, and Ascertaining the English Tongue.</em><br>
  * He was concerned about the awful state of the English language.<br>
  * “Like” is thought to be meaningless or a sign that a person has a limited vocabulary, or that “like” can be used anywhere in a sentence, etc.<br>
  * Are these beliefs correct? Let’s look at the data!<br>
    * In particular, usages like the following are condemned:<br>
      > “He looks like he’s like twelve, or like eight”<br>
      > Tommy was like, “I’m tired of buying you burritos.”<br>
      > “Like, the first flight, I was like totally sick.”<br>
    * This use of “like is associated with popular culture and adolescents and young adults.<br>

* Studies show that people who use “like’ as above are perceived as less educated, intelligent, or interesting<br>
* Attitudes towards “like” are generally negative.<br>
* <strong>One use of "like" is an innovation. Can you see how "like" is used?</strong><br>
  > "I was like, "Where do you find these people?"<br>
  > "She was like, 'Okay, but I don't normally fry rutabagas.'"<br>
  > "The policeman was like, 'Kaboom!"<br>
* What is "like" doing in this kind of sentence?<br>
* In these cases, colloquial "like" introduces a quote, a thought, reported speech.<br>
* It is a "quotative complementizer."<br>

* <strong>Another use of "like" is found in the following sentences:</strong><br>
  > "Mary read like 7 books in two weeks."<br>
  > "It was like 108F when we arrived at the beach."<br>
  > "It took all day just to go like thirty miles."<br>
* In these cases, "like" functions as signal approximation.<br>
  > "Mary read about 7 books in two weeks."<br>
  > "Like" also functions as an "approximative adverb."<br>

* <strong>"Like" also occurs in sentences such as... (usually in sentence-initial position):</strong><br>
  > "I love Jenny. Like, she's a little out-of-it, but like, she's really funny. Like, she's a space cadet."<br>
  > "Like one of my cats meows so much. Because like he's really picky about the food he'll eat."<br>
  > "I hate that professor. Like, he always wants us to spell correctly."<br>
* This use of "like" is a little tricky, but it signals a relationship between sentences in a discourse.<br>
* This relationship could be one of exemplification, illustration, explanation, etc.<br>

* <strong>“Like” functions as a “discourse marker”</strong><br>
  * There is nothing simple about this use of “like!”<br>

* <strong>What about the following use of "like?"</strong><br>
  > "The teacher like totally failed me in that class. I only missed half of the answers!"<br>
  > "He's like dumb or something. He seems nice, but he's like real dumb."<br>
* This use of "like" is rather subtle too.<br>
* In these cases, "like" is used as a focus marker. It tells the listener that what follows is important, or emphasizes it.<br>
* Here, "like" also functions as a discourse particle.<br>

* Toronto study identified four distinct uses of colloquial “like:”<br>
  1. Quotative “like”:<br>
  2. Approximation “like”<br>
  3. Discourse maker: “like”<br>
  4. Discourse or emphatic particle: “like”<br>

* People associate these uses of “like” with young people and adolescents.  However, the Toronto study revealed that people of all age groups used “like” in the ways just outlined.<br>

## Linguistic Profiling
### Purnell, Idsardi, and Baugh Study
Can we find other cases where attitudes about dialect speakers is manifested as attitudes about language?<br>
<strong>Linguistic Profiling</strong> is using the characteristics of a person’s speech to identify them as a member of a particular group.<br>

<em>Purnell, Idsardi, and Baugh (1999)</em> wanted to test if there was dialect based discrimination and whether ethnic group affiliation was recoverable from speech.<br>
* Specifically, they wanted to know the extent to which discrimination by race or ethnicity could be based only on linguistic profiling.<br>
* They focused on the dialects of: Standard American English, African American Vernacular English, Chicano English<br>
* They also looked at housing distribution<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/213971656-0e311120-82a6-4c03-ba2f-7996d55a9cb2.png)<br>

* The experimenters called different landlords pretending to be potential tenants, saying “Hello” in different dialects, and tested to see how many return calls they received.<br>
* They found people did discriminate based on dialect.<br><br>

## Signed Languages
Sign languages are around us, but this type of language diversity often goes unrecognized.<br>
<strong>Signed languages:</strong>
* Used primarily by deaf people.<br>
* Uses a different medium than spoken language.<br>
* Hands, face, and eyes. (Rather than vocal tract or ears)<br>

### American Sign Language (ASL)
Primary language of deaf people in the USA and Anglophone Canada<br>
* 2 million profoundly deaf people in the U.S.<br>
* 90% of deaf babies are born to hearing parents.<br>
* At least 100,000+ ASL users<br>

<strong>Is ASL a real language?</strong><br>
<strong>Myth 1:</strong> Sign language is universal<br>
* There are many different signed languages! Just like there are many spoke languages.<br>
* There are about 300 sign languages in the world.<br>
* They are mutually unintelligible.  (An American sign language user cannot Chinese sign language)<br>
* In fact, just like spoken languages, there can be <strong>dialects</strong> of a signed language.<br>
* For example, one dialect of ASL is “<strong>Black ASL</strong>,” used primarily by deaf African-Americans<br><br>

<strong>Myth 2:</strong> Sign language is purely iconic, or just gestures<br>
* However most signs in any sign language are simply unguessable and not iconic<br>
* But, if all signs were iconic… <br>
  * Non-signers would understand sign language.<br>
  * All deaf people would have the same signs<br>
  * Wouldn’t be able to sign abstract concepts<br>
* Recall: Iconicity occurs in spoken language to some degree (onomatopoeia)<br>

The idea that signed languages are iconic or pantomime is the basis for the notion it’s not as expressive as spoken language.<br>
* You can curse and joke in ASL, just like you can curse or joke in any spoken language.<br><br>

<strong>Myth 3:</strong> Signed languages encode spoken languages<br>
For American Sign Language, this is the idea that ASL is really just “English on the hands.”<br>
However, ASL, even though used in the United States, is not English<br>

<strong>Temporal Inflection</strong> in ASL:<br>
ASL verbs inflect for whether something happened once, happens regularly, or continuously<br>
* Example - sign for "vomit"<br>
  > Vomit (once) \*waving hands once from the mouth\*<br>
  > Vomit (regularly) \*waving hands, pause, waving hands\*<br>
  > Vomit (continuously) \*LOTS OF WAVING\*<br>
* This is standardized.<br>

This idea is probably fostered by the existence of <em><strong>fingerspelling</strong></em>, which is used in a number of sign languages to translate names of things from an oral language that have no sign.<br>

<strong>A note on fingerspelling:</strong><br>
* Fingerspelling is a manual representation of the letters of a language, oftentimes when there is no sign for a word.<br>
* In ASL, it is used to represent:<br>
  * Proper names<br>
  * Titles<br>
  * Addresses<br>

Different sign languages use different signed alphabets.  (ex. British Sign Language uses <strong>two hands</strong> while American Sign Language uses <strong>one hand</strong>.)<br>

<strong>Myth 4:</strong> signed languages are just strings of handmotions<br>
* Another way of saying this is that signed languages have no grammar<br>
* What would we expect to find if signed languages were not rule-governed?<br>
* You should be able to sign whatever you want!<br>
* The shape of the hand matters in signed languages<br>
* Five basic parameters:<br>
  1. Shape of the hand<br>
  2. Place of articulation<br>
  3. Movement.<br>
  4. Palm Orientation<br>
    * Region of the hand contacting body.<br>
    * Orientation of the hand to body.<br>
    * Orientation of hands to each other.<br>
  5. Facial Expressions<br>

Each signed language has a restricted set of handshapes that can be used.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>  Taiwanese Sign Language has two handshapes that are simply ungrammatical in ASL<br>

These handshapes are found in, for example, the words for:<br>
