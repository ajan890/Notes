## Language Variations

### Dialect Differences
Is the way that any one person or group of people speak better than anyone else's?<br>
Are there any differences between the following greeting?<br>
  > "How are you doing?"<br>
  > "How are you?"<br>
  > "How ya doin'?"<br>
  > "What's up?"<br>
  > "Whazz up?"<br>
Which of these would you most likely use with:<br>
  * A sibling?<br>
  * A friend?<br>
  * Your professor?<br>
  * Your grandmother?<br>
  * The Queen of England?<br>
This goes to show that none of them are wrong; you just use them in different situations.<br>
The same goes with language in general; there is no "better" or "worse" way to speak.<br>

### What is a Dialect?
The <strong>popular understanding</strong> goes as follows:<br>
  * A <strong>dialect</strong> is a type of pseudo-language spoken by uneducated or country people.<br>
    * Only the speech of socially disfavored groups is "dialect."<br>
    * Those who speak the language "correctly" do not speak "dialect."<br>
  * In popular speech, dialect just refers to speech that is different from one's own speech.<br>
  * Dialect is also commonly conceived of as a corrupt form of the "correct" language.  It is <em>derived</em> from the "correct" form.<br>
  * The common conception is that dialects represent unsuccessful attempts to speak the standard language.<br>
    * In reality, children acquire the speech of their communities.<br>
  * Unlike the standard language, dialects are often perceived as lacking grammatical rules.<br>
    * In reality, all dialects (like all language systems) are regular and rule governed.<br>
  * <strong>This popular definition is WRONG!</strong><br>

The <strong>linguistic definition</strong> goes as follows:<br>
* A <strong>dialect</strong> refers to any variety of a language that si shared by a group of speakers.<br>
  * So, <strong>everyone</strong> speaks a dialect of their language.<br>
  * From this perspective, there is no such thing as a "good" or "bad" or "better" or "worse" dialect.<br>
  * In fact, a <strong>language</strong> is a <strong>collection of dialects</strong>, one of which has been adopted as the <strong>standard variety</strong>, which people think of as "the language."<br>
    * The standard variety is simply one dialect of a language.  For a variety of historical and social reasons, this dialect may end up being the "standard."<br>

### Characteristics of a Standard Language
<strong>Selection:</strong><br>
* The dialect of the ruling or most influential class is adopted as the standard.<br>

<strong>Literacy:</strong><br>
* It acquires a written form.<br>

<strong>Standardization:</strong><br>
* A grammar that provides the "rules" of the language.<br>

<strong>Authoritative dictionary:</strong><br>
* Such as Oxford English Dictionary.<br>

<strong>Spelling/writing is fixed:</strong><br>
* If there are competing grammatical or spelling forms, one is adopted as correct and the other(s) are deemed incorrect.<br>

<strong>A "correct" pronunciation.</strong><br>

<strong>Public Life:</strong><br>
* Taught in schools, used in official transactions.<br>

### Prestige Dialects
One dialect is often considered a <strong>prestige dialect</strong> while others are considered <strong>"substandard."</strong>.<br>

Prestige dialects are often associated with positive attributes:<br>
* Education level<br>
* Sophistication<br>
* Intelligence<br>
* etc.<br>

Substandard dialects are often associated with the reverse:<br>
* Ignorance<br>
* Lack of Education<br>
* Lack of Intelligence<br>
* Laziness<br>
* etc.<br>

## Language Variation

### Understanding Variation
Language is used differently in different contexts.<br>
* We may all be speakers of English but may be speakers of somewhat different dialects.<br>
* For instance, which of the following terms do you use?<br>
  > 1. Do you put groceries in a bag, a sack, or a poke?<br>
  > 2. Pepsi, Dr. Pepper, Sprite, etc. are all types of soda, pop, soda pop, tonic, or coke?<br>
  > 3. On summer nights, do children catch fireflies, lightning bugs, fire bugs, or glow worms?<br>

### Different Criterias
Language varies according to:<br>
1. Geography<br>
2. Social class<br>
3. Political ideology<br>
4. Age<br>
5. Gender<br>
6. Sexual orientation<br>
7. Situation<br>
8. Time<br>

### Geographic Variation
* If variation is based on geographical origin, we talk about regional or <strong>geographical dialects</strong>.<br>
* If variation is based on social background, we talk about <strong>social dialects</strong>.<br>
