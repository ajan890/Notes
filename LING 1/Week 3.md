# Week 3
## Brain and Language
* Essential Questions:<br>
  * Where is language processed in the brain?<br>
  * Are all aspects of language processed in the same part of the brain?<br>
  * What happens if there is brain damage in the language area?<br>

### Structure of a Neuron
* See diagram:<br>

* Electric impulses enter a neuron from the dendrites, and its output is sent through the axon.  The ending of the axon touches the dendrites of neighboring neurons.<br>

### Brain Structure
* The brain is composed of a larger structure called a <strong>cortex</strong>.<br>

* The cortex is composed of billions of <strong>neural cell bodies</strong>.<br>
* The brain also contains <strong>gray matter</strong> and <strong>white matter</strong>.<br>

* Towards the center of the brain is the <strong>Corpus Callosum</strong>, which is a bundle of axons (or "white matter") that connects the two hemispheres.<br>

* The brain is organized in such a way that the left hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body, and the right hemisphere of the brain controls the left.  This phenomenon is called <strong>contralateral control</strong>.<br>
  * In other words, input from one side of the body is sent to the opposite side of the brain. <br>

### Phrenology
* <strong>Phrenology</strong> was an old pseudoscience that each part of the brain was for different aspects of the personality, and they were "organs" independent from one another.  If one part of your personality was used more than others, then that part of the brain would grow bigger like any other muscle in the body, and it would be possible to "read" a person's personality just by feeling for bumps on their head.<br>
  * This was eventually proven to be false.<br>
  * The language "section", according to Phrenology, was located in the section directly below the eye (not in the brain).<br><br>

### Lateralization
* Phrenology developed the idea that different parts of the brain were used for different things.<br>

* Language is evidenced to be lateralized to the left hemisphere:<br>
  * Dichotic Listening<br>
    * A test done where the test subject listens to two different sounds simultaneously through both ears.<br> 
    * Interestingly, subjects only report hearing one sound, and more importantly, the sound they hear is almost always the sound played in the right ear.<br>
  * Split Brain Patients<br>
    * In order to counter severe epilepsy, some patients have their Corpus Callosum severed, but as a side effect, the two halves of the brain cannot communicate.<br>
    * The subject focuses on a dot, and images of different objects will appear on either sides.  Since the left side of the brain controls language, the subject is only able to name the object on the right side, but not the object on the left side.  However, when asked to draw the object on the left side, they were able to, since drawing is controlled by the right hemisphere of the brain.<br>
  * Wada Test<br>
    * Left hemisphere of the brain is temporarily anesthesized.<br>
    * An object is put in the subject's left hand; they cannot say what they are holding because the language function does not work.  However, when given images of items, they are able to point to which item they were holding.<br>
    * This implies that they are able to see the object, although they cannot name what it is.<br>
    * 95% of population have language handled in the left side of the brain.  About 5% have it on the right side.  It is important to find the language module before conducting surgery in order to prevent interference with language.<br>
  * Aphasiology<br>
    * <strong>Broca's Area</strong> and <strong>Werniche's Area</strong> are located in the frontal and temporal lobes, respectively.<br>

      * These two areas are believed to be "language centers".<br>
      * Much of early knowledge of these areas comes from aphasiology, which is the study of <strong>aphasia</strong>, or a disruption in langauge abilities due to brain injury.<br>
        * <strong>Case Study: Tan's Brain.</strong>  Tan was a French man who was admitted to a mental hospital when he was about 30 years old in 1840, and had lost the ability to speak.  The only syllable he was able to say was "Tan," but it was often accompanied by very expressive hand gestures and body language.<br>
          * Doctors learned that Tan was able to understand language, but was unable to reproduce it.  He never regained his ability to speak, and eventually died in the hospital.<br>
          * After Tan's death in 1861, French surgeon <strong>Paul Broca</strong> examined Tan's brain and found out that the specific area in the frontal lobe was damaged, leading to loss of language.<br>
          * After looking at others with similar language deficits, he concluded that language was linked to local damage in "Broca's Area".<br>
      * Characteristics of Broca's Aphasia:<br>
        * Speech is broken and halted (telegraphic speech)<br>
        * Words make some sense, but structure is incorrect<br>
        * Also known as "agrammatic aphasia"<br>
        * Good comprehension of simple sentences:<br>
          > "The dog bit the woman."<br>
          > "The apple is red."<br>
        * Poor comprehension of complex, passive sentences:<br>
          > "The car is pushed by the truck."<br>
        * Semantics (meaning): OK<br>
        * Syntax (structure): Not OK<br>
        * Comprehension: Mostly OK<br>
  * Brain Imaging Techniques (fMRI)<br>
