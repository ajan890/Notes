# Week 3
## Brain and Language
* Essential Questions:<br>
  * Where is language processed in the brain?<br>
  * Are all aspects of language processed in the same part of the brain?<br>
  * What happens if there is brain damage in the language area?<br>

### Structure of a Neuron
* See diagram:<br>

* Electric impulses enter a neuron from the dendrites, and its output is sent through the axon.  The ending of the axon touches the dendrites of neighboring neurons.<br>

### Brain Structure
* The brain is composed of a larger structure called a <strong>cortex</strong>.<br>

* The cortex is composed of billions of <strong>neural cell bodies</strong>.<br>
* The brain also contains <strong>gray matter</strong> and <strong>white matter</strong>.<br>

* Towards the center of the brain is the <strong>Corpus Callosum</strong>, which is a bundle of axons (or "white matter") that connects the two hemispheres.<br>

* The brain is organized in such a way that the left hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body, and the right hemisphere of the brain controls the left.  This phenomenon is called <strong>contralateral control</strong>.<br>
  * In other words, input from one side of the body is sent to the opposite side of the brain. <br>

### Phrenology
* <strong>Phrenology</strong> was an old pseudoscience that each part of the brain was for different aspects of the personality, and they were "organs" independent from one another.  If one part of your personality was used more than others, then that part of the brain would grow bigger like any other muscle in the body, and it would be possible to "read" a person's personality just by feeling for bumps on their head.<br>
  * This was eventually proven to be false.<br>
  * The language "section", according to Phrenology, was located in the section directly below the eye (not in the brain).<br><br>

### Lateralization
* Phrenology developed the idea that different parts of the brain were used for different things.<br>

* Language is evidenced to be lateralized to the left hemisphere:<br>
  * Dichotic Listening<br>
    * A test done where the test subject listens to two different sounds simultaneously through both ears.<br> 
    * Interestingly, subjects only report hearing one sound, and more importantly, the sound they hear is almost always the sound played in the right ear.<br>
  * Split Brain Patients<br>
    * In order to counter severe epilepsy, some patients have their Corpus Callosum severed, but as a side effect, the two halves of the brain cannot communicate.<br>
    * The subject focuses on a dot, and images of different objects will appear on either sides.  Since the left side of the brain controls language, the subject is only able to name the object on the right side, but not the object on the left side.  However, when asked to draw the object on the left side, they were able to, since drawing is controlled by the right hemisphere of the brain.<br>
  * Wada Test<br>
    * Left hemisphere of the brain is temporarily anesthesized.<br>
    * An object is put in the subject's left hand; they cannot say what they are holding because the language function does not work.  However, when given images of items, they are able to point to which item they were holding.<br>
    * This implies that they are able to see the object, although they cannot name what it is.<br>
    * 95% of population have language handled in the left side of the brain.  About 5% have it on the right side.  It is important to find the language module before conducting surgery in order to prevent interference with language.<br>
  * Aphasiology<br>
    * <strong>Broca's Area</strong> and <strong>Werniche's Area</strong> are located in the frontal and temporal lobes, respectively.<br>
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/214526292-627b04d6-b130-407c-82de-607715c17ca1.png)<br>
      * These two areas are believed to be "language centers".<br>
      * Much of early knowledge of these areas comes from aphasiology, which is the study of <strong>aphasia</strong>, or a disruption in langauge abilities due to brain injury.<br>
        * <strong>Case Study: Tan's Brain.</strong>  Tan was a French man who was admitted to a mental hospital when he was about 30 years old in 1840, and had lost the ability to speak.  The only syllable he was able to say was "Tan," but it was often accompanied by very expressive hand gestures and body language.<br>
          * Doctors learned that Tan was able to understand language, but was unable to reproduce it.  He never regained his ability to speak, and eventually died in the hospital.<br>
          * After Tan's death in 1861, French surgeon <strong>Paul Broca</strong> examined Tan's brain and found out that the specific area in the frontal lobe was damaged, leading to loss of language.<br>
          * After looking at others with similar language deficits, he concluded that language was linked to local damage in "Broca's Area".<br>
      * Characteristics of Broca's Aphasia:<br>
        * Speech is broken and halted (telegraphic speech)<br>
        * Words make some sense, but structure is incorrect<br>
        * Also known as "agrammatic aphasia"<br>
        * Good comprehension of simple sentences:<br>
          > "The dog bit the woman."<br>
          > "The apple is red."<br>
        * Poor comprehension of complex, passive sentences:<br>
          > "The car is pushed by the truck."<br>
        * Semantics (meaning): OK<br>
        * Syntax (structure): Not OK<br>
        * Comprehension: Mostly OK<br>
        * If written, few words, but they make sense.<br>
    * <strong>Wernicke's Aphasia</strong><br>
      * Carl Wernicke observed language deficits that did not involve Broca's Area.<br>
      * He found that they have brain damage, but to a different area of the brain.<br>
      * In 1874, he identified deficit associated with damage to an area in the temporal lobe, now referred to as Wernicke’s Area.<br>
      * Characteristics of Wernicke's Area:<br>
        * Speech is fluent, but doesn’t make much sense.<br>
        * Grammar is usually not affected.<br>
        * Problems with word choice and meaning.<br>
        * Comprehension severely impaired.<br>
        * Also known as semantic aphasia.<br>
        * If written, many words, but they make little sense.<br>
    * <strong>What can we learn from aphasiology?</strong><br>
      * Language function isn't housed in a simple "box" in the brain.<br>
      * Discrete areas control different aspects of language.<br>
  * Brain Imaging Techniques (fMRI)<br>
    * Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)<br>
    * Creates a movie of brain functions: video, not static image<br>
    * An MRI machine is a gigantic electromagnet (30000 times stronger than Earth's magnetic field)<br>
    * The machine meaures changes to the magnetic properties of anything inside the magnet<br>
    * fMRI is an indirect method of measuring brain activity<br>
    * When neurons become active in a part of the brain, oxygenated blood is pumped to that area.<br>
    * Oxygenated blood has different magnetic properties than de-oxgenated blood, and gives a bigger MRI signal.<br>
    * End result: when a neuron fires, the MRI signal goes up.<br>
    * Example Time-Courses for fMRI tests:<br>

### Neuroimaging and Sign Languages
Researcher made fMRI scans of brain activation areas in people processing <strong>English</strong> and <strong>British Sign Language (BSL):</strong><br>
 * Hearing English subjects reading English sentences.<br>
 * Hearing BSL signers looking at BSL sentences.<br>
 * Deaf BSL signers looking at BSL sentences<br>

 * Languages is laterized to the left hemisphere<br>
 * Broca’s area and Wernicke’s area in the left hemisphere are two of the brain’s language centers<br>
 * fMRI image techniques show that signed and spoken languages both activate Broca’s and Wenicke’s Areas.<br>

## Language and the Brain
* Are language abilities intertwined with or separate from other cognitive functions<br>
* In other words, is there a relationship between **language abilities** and **general intelligence**?<br>

### Language and Intelligence
* People often associate language ability with intelligence<br>
* If language abilities are tied to general intelligence, what should we find?<br>
	 > Low IQ -> Poor language ability<br>
  > High IQ -> Strong language ability<br>
* Is this pattern true?<br>
#### SLI (Specific Language Impairment)
* Affects about 7-8% of kindergarten age children:<br>
* Very specific types of difficulty with language:<br>
* Children with SLI often omit “function” or grammatical words like ‘of, the is’ etc.<br>
  > “Meowmeow chase mice.”<br>
  > “Show me knife.”<br>
  > “It not long one.”<br>
* Children may start speaking late, and may be hard to understand<br>
* Children have normal IQ and normal ability in all other areas, including speech comprehension and hearing.<br>
* It is only linguistic ability and often only specific aspects of their grammar that are impaired<br>
* Areas of difficulty in SLI patients:<br>
  * **Functional Words:** <br>
    > “He like me?” instead of “Does he like me?”<br>
  * **Tense/person marking on words**<br>
    > “He walk.” instead of “He walks”<br>
    > “He walk.” instead of “He walked.”<br>
  * **Plural marking on nouns:**<br>
    > “Those dog.” instead of “Those dogs.”<br>
    > “Four chair.” instead of “Four chairs.”<br>
* SLI Example Studies:<br>
  * Rice and Oetting, 1993<br>
    * Participants:<br>
      * 50 5-year-old children with SLI<br>
      * 58 non-SLI younger children (mean age 38 months)<br>
    * Both groups of children used sentences of comparable length<br>
    * <strong>Procedure:</strong><br>
      * Researchers recorded spontaneous speech.<br>
      * They evaluated plural endings on nouns and the 3rd ‘-s’ ending on verbs (walks)<br>
    * <strong>Results:</strong><br>
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66571533/215822856-86ead0c5-af7e-49e0-a301-0bb36b204e01.png)<br>
    * If language abilities are tied to general intelligence, then we expect to find:<br>
      * High -> IQ strong language ability<br>
      * SLI is a case where this expected correlation does not hold.<br>
    * If language is really <strong>separate</strong> from other aspects of general intelligence, then we would expect that there are cases with intact language ability, but low general intelligence.<br>
#### William's Syndrome
* Overall IQ: 40-90, Average IQ: 55<br>
* Limited spatial and motor skills. (May not be able to tie shoes or cut with a knife)<br>
* Extremely social and friendly.<br>
* High level of vocabulary and grammar; sometimes slightly “off” semantics.<br>
* Better-than-average in facial recognition<br>
* Often love music<br>
* William’s syndrome is the result of deletion from one copy of approximation twenty contiguous genes on chromosome 7<br>
  * Occurs in 1 in 25000 births.<br>
  * Subjects often have a pixie or “elfin” appearance. <br>
* <strong>Experimenter’s question:</strong> “What if you were a bird?”<br>
* <strong>Williams subjects’ answers:</strong><br>
  > “You could fly, you could have babies, fly north or south, east or west.”<br>
  > “I would fly throught the air and soar like an airplane and dive through trees like a bird.”<br>
  > “I would fly where my parents could never find me. Birds want to be independent.”<br>
  > “I would fly and if I liked a boy, I would land on his head and start chirping.”<br>
* <strong>Williams Syndrome Language Ability</strong><br>
  * Homonym: a word that sounds like another word.<br>
  * Experimenter: what does “nuts” mean?<br>
  * William’s syndrome subject answer:  “There are two kinds of nuts, a peanut, and nuts, and bolts”<br>
  * Experimenter: what does “club” mean?<br>
  * Answer: “A secret kind of club, and a club with spurs, those pointy things for killing animals”<br>
* <strong>Summary of Williams Syndrome</strong><br>
  * If language abilities are tied to general intelligence, then we expect to find:<br>
    * Low IQ -> Poor language ability<br>
    * But we find the opposite.<br>
    * Subjects have strong language ability, along with low general IQ.<br>
